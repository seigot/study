Thank you all for being here. We're going to wait another minute or two to let people enter.
04:49
All right, I want to be respectful of people's time. Thank you all for being here. My name is Wendy Hunter Barker. I am the assistant Dean on strategy and external relations here at the Rady school. And it is my pleasure to welcome you to the 2025 MBA micro MBA program.
05:06
I'm going to give just a few words about the program before I turn it over to our first faculty speaker, Professor Pam Smith. So, thank you Professor Smith for giving us a little bit of the time to go over the program in advance. Uh, I think you all know what you got yourself into you all registered and paid, but as a reminder, we'll be having 12 online sessions with Reedy faculty.
05:34
We will additionally have two opportunities a minimum of two for you to network with local industry leaders who are at the Nexus of the business science. Centerpoint. So, in case you're interested in making a quarter shift or just understanding how you might advance in a particular type of Industry that merges both business and science.
05:56
You'll have some opportunities to speak with people who have done that. Uh, and networking amongst yourselves is something that we keep your time and again as a very valuable piece of this experience, and we'll have two opportunities for you to do that, um, amongst yourselves. This schedule, you'll be with us starting today, every Monday and Wednesday for the next seven weeks.
06:20
We start at 4 30 and go to six o'clock. There is one session Professor Floyd's session on accounting is a two-hour session, so that is noted in the schedule, but I wanted to call it to your attention. It is the one session that's a bit longer. And then again.
06:36
As we mentioned, there are some networking opportunities for you, understanding that you're not all here in San Diego. We do have an online networking session that will host next week. There will be some questions there will be breakout rooms. We'll mix you up a couple of times, so it'll be a great opportunity to get to know the different people in the program.
06:56
About 270 people have signed up for the program, so there'll be a lot of folks for you to get to know. Over the next seven weeks, so we hope you'll be able to come to. This online session, even if you are here in San Diego. And then, we have always an end of program reception on August 20th.
07:17
I will be in person and you'll receive more information as we get closer to the date. Now, you're here to earn a certificate. There are three things you need to do in order to earn that certificate, and I can't stress this first one enough because it comes up year, year over year.
07:33
You have to attend 10 of the 12 sessions live. Um, and you need to respond to a reflection question, so we track attendance via Zoom. Um, please make sure that your name matches your enrolled name so that we can, and uh, make sure that the two align. Please make sure you're on each call for at least 60 minutes of the 90 minute section.
08:00
That's how we will track you if you're here for 45 minutes, that's not a majority of the session. You will not receive, uh, having you won't receive credit for having attended that session. So, again, you can miss two classes, two of the sessions. Um, you have to stay at least 60 minutes, and we're gonna check that via Zoom.
08:21
So, if you end up having connectivity issues, log back in. Make sure that you're reaching out to our Zoom coordinators, and I'll give you their login information later. If you haven't already connected with them. Um, we want to make sure you get your certificate in order to get that certificate you got to attend.
08:39
At least 10 of these sessions? And that includes being on the line for at least 60 minutes, and then there's a reflection question in canvas that we're going to be offering at the end of this. So, this is an opportunity for you to just spend a few moments thinking about what you've learned and how you might apply it in your day-to-day.
08:56
So again, and um, that's part of it. The second part is, you have to attend two copy chats this. By and large is our most popular part, people really enjoy the coffee chats, so you'll be allowed to sign up for two. You should have already received an email about it.
09:13
Hopefully, actually, a couple emails, hopefully. Already signed up for your first two. Um, once that's happened, and everyone has their two. We'll open up any that have remaining space, so you can sign up for more than two. If that is your your desired? I think in the chat we're going to be putting down the link for you to sign up.
09:33
In case you didn't see that email. And there is just a note that the majority of them will be virtual. And then there are two, the ones that are in person will be at the cafe, which is near the Rady school, and there's the map and information on the canvas site.
09:48
So, guys, you're there! All right. Lastly, program evaluation at the end of each year. We do require that you do an evaluation of the program so we can continue to grow and evolve and meet your needs, so that also will be a requirement. And once you do those three easy steps.
10:07
You will get your verifiable digital credential that you can share on social media, put on your LinkedIn, and verify that you have been a part of this fantastic program. So, if you have any questions throughout the program, I'm not going to take questions here, but you can put them in the chat.
10:27
Sit hunt is. In the chat, making sure that he can answer any questions you might have. You can also send it to micro MBA at rayby.ucsd.edu. We have several people monitoring that inbox throughout the length of this program, so please feel free to ask any questions there, and so that I don't take any more time.
10:48
I'm going to stop and say thank you very much. Professor Smith for giving us the opportunity to share this and I will turn it over to you. Great! Thank you, Wendy, um! All right, everybody. Let me pull up my slides. Good afternoon. Good evening to everybody. I see we have.
11:11
A lot of people coming in from San Diego, but also from all over the United States so. I know we have at least person one person who I saw was attending from their car. I hope you are driving safely. Um. We'll make this work all right. You should be able to see my slides now.
11:32
Excellent. So, what we're going to talk about today? Is the? Issue of networking, which, of course, as soon as Wendy said, oh, you need to sign up for when, for networking stuff, I thought this is great. It's a lovely intro to what we are going to be talking about today.
11:53
So, I study power. I do research on power. I teach about power, and one thing that I one topic that I find that tends to be very immediately impactful for people is thinking much more systematically and much more thoroughly about their social network and about networking more broadly. So, what we're going to talk about, actually, let me go ahead.
12:15
So, we're going to talk about characteristics of social networks. If you had a chance to complete the survey before class, awesome. Because we'll be talking about some aspects of your social network, which you'll be able to think about more deeply because you've been. You've been thinking about your social network as part of that survey.
12:35
If you didn't have a chance to do it yet, it'll still be available. And also just in general. You can start thinking about what does your social network look like? Once I talk to you about these characteristics, you'll have tools where you can think more deeply. Is this network the kind of network I want, and also am I utilizing it to the best extent?
12:57
Um, so continuing on with that, we'll also be talking about identifying the network structure that fits your needs and your goals. Whenever I teach. Uh, refrain people here. A lot for me is that there are no absolutes in this stuff, and the first, the first sign somebody is trying to lie to you.
13:18
Frankly, is, if they say, everybody needs to do X. This is rarely true in your present environment. Since most of you are supplement, most of you are scientists. You already know this. This is very rare that we can talk in absolutes. It's often a matter of it depends. We're dealing at areas of probability as opposed to zero or one.
13:42
And the same thing here. Where, when we talk about Network structures, it's important to think about what are your needs. What are your goals. And then we'll talk about what are the network structures that would be best for you? And finally, we'll talk. You know, this is all going to have to be a little surface level because we only have an hour and a half, but I'll talk a bit about building, maintaining, and using your social network.
14:05
A few key tips and tricks for that. Um, I have at least one book I'm gonna recommend to you along the way, which can help you out some more. So, with all that being said, let's get started. Um, to make sure we're all on the same page. When I see social network, what I mean is simply a set of relationships between people and what you see on your screen here.
14:29
This is classically how researchers will talk about social networks, where they'll depict them in terms of nodes. So that's the little circles. And then lines that are representing ties or connections between nodes. Oh my goodness, let me see if there's anything. Okay, no, sorry. I had noticed I had 32 new messages in the chat.
14:53
None of those are immediately relevant, though, so that's helpful. All right, so this is what a social network is. It is not going to surprise most of you, hopefully, that your social networks are important to give some hardcore numbers behind it. There's a lot of data that suggests that social networks affect people's likelihood of getting a job.
15:16
So, just a representative survey of workers and January 2020? 35 percent of them. These are workers in the US, said that they were referred to their current job by an existing employee, which is just one example of your social network playing a key role and you getting your job.
15:37
Um, and I feel like 35, is this does, you know, this is only being referred by an existing employee that's only one facet of how our networks play a role of getting a job so that 35 is really that's a minimum. It's not the true. I feel like the true number of jobs we, the percentage of jobs that are gotten via social networks, is much higher.
16:02
And it's not just about getting a job, our likelihood of getting promoted is affected by your social networks, the kind of salary rate, whether we get bonus, how much are bonuses, how effective we are as managers, other things we do at our job, like our likelihood being innovate, how easy or hard we find it to transfer knowledge between people, the learning and Developmental opportunities we get access to.
16:30
Teach career transitions quality of our work life. And, you know, frankly, our general health and well-being are all going to be affected by our social networks. Um, but of course. It's not just gonna be about social networks in general. It's about the specific kinds of social networks we have.
16:49
So, the first thing we're going to be talking about today is Network properties. Um. But before we get to that, I do want to just to see if we are. How people are feeling about this. Let me launch a little poll. I'd like to find out from you all.
17:08
How important would you say your social network is to you being successful? However, you want to define success, and you can see it goes from one. Not at all all the way to five critical.
17:33
Coming up. Um, all right, a few more people trickling in here. Make sure you complete the poll in. Should be able to see all right. I'm gonna end that. New, let's share those results. All right, you should be able to see. Thumbs up! If you can see the results on the screen yeah, sweet.
17:59
So? As you can see, not at all important is selected by almost nobody. Um, vast. Majority of you are saying. It's very important. There's the next most popular answer is critical. Do you all feel already that social networks your social network has been moderately important all the way from model A important to critical in terms of your success?
18:31
But, of course, that leaves open the question of what aspects of your social network are you most concerned about and least concerned about? So, this is the point where? Uh, Sonata, um, I'd like you can you put Stu. Can you put the students into rooms? Of three people. Can you put people into breakout rooms for me?
18:57
Now, sure, I'll just do that. Thank you, and we'll just. I'm just going to give you about five ten minutes to quickly talk amongst yourselves about the parts of your social network, your most and least concerned about in these breakout rooms. Okay. If you can send people out now?
19:37
Rooms at two to three, right? Yeah, two to three.
20:13
Hi, what was the question again? The question, I think, what is the most concerned? Like, what are the concerns, uh? Or, like, most concerned, at least concerned, you are interestingly, right? Um, yeah. So, probably my like, he's concerned is like, the quality is about connections. I feel like, I know, some pretty high people, some pretty actors.
20:39
Anything else like that? Um, probably one of my bigger concerns is like keeping connections rather than reaching out to them. Let them know them. Everything that I have, like, going on, and everybody else like that.
20:56
Because I, if you have so many connections on my LinkedIn unless you make, like, in person who can't reach out to all, that's awesome, and every you know. So it's really just figuring out how to best feel better. Yeah. To me. I think it's a different answers and Academia.
21:22
I sometimes have the concern of what is the other one's purpose. Like, for example, when we discuss about some research projects, like if they ask me about the data, or they asked me to provide the data like, yeah, sometimes It's Tricky, like, you want to build up a network.
21:42
You want to have collaborations about how much you could trust the other person. It's my biggest concern, I think.
21:59
Uh, for me, I'm concerning about. You? The about the background of all participants. In my case, I work as a software engineer. I'm going to be an AI. Ai engineer. But all most of them are not software engineer so. In this micron, VA, I direct. Your background and your hypothesis like that?
22:35
Thank you.
22:43
That's all.
22:50
So, how do you feel like y'all networks are like, naturally, do y'all feel like, I know, a lot of people in different areas and everything else like that, and like different Industries?
23:06
I'm sorry. What? What was your last sentence? I didn't. The girl was broke. Now, I'm just asking, like, how do you? How do you personally feel about your network and everything else like that? Oh yeah. In the survey, I'm a postag researcher, so I'm still in Acne. Um, and I found that most of my network.
23:30
Except for just one, like all the others are professors, like, who are in Academia, which I also aim first in Academia. So it makes sense, but I, yeah, I don't know how to make my, um, networking more diverse and how they would help me in the future. Yeah, that's, I guess, a question I do think about?
23:55
Okay. Look, are you like you symbols in in industry, and how does like industry networking? Um, well, like I had the chance to like, go to, like a lot of conferences. A lot of like immersions about, like, basic stuff, and everything else like that, um. But yeah, it just really depends just on the connection.
24:21
And really, just following up and like the type of relationship that you have with, like the person and everything else like that. Yeah, it makes sense. I also found that it's easy to know someone at a conference, but it's more difficult to maintain a relationship. Also to deepen the relationship.
24:42
Sometimes, I follow up with people I met, uh, on, like, in a conference like for emails. So, for a couple emails, but it was very like on a surface level like superficial level and. You know, like, for most people, I couldn't really build up a connection that I couldn't, you know, like, or a collaboration in the future?
25:08
Now, so? And everything else like that, but it's just really just trying to develop them and really stay on top because they it takes a. It takes a lot of like time, effort, and energy. If there's a way to like, do it because I feel like linkedin's cool, but?
25:26
Everything else is okay. Yeah, yeah, great. It definitely consumes a lot of energy. I actually to me. Well, the top energy consuming thing because I'm, I feel like, I'm not very good at it. And, um. And also, like, I need more time to do research and right branch. And, like, when it comes to networking, it feels like an extra.
25:52
Burden to, you know, to follow up with people and to to do networking. Uh, yeah, but I feel like it's not worth it. Yeah, yeah, definitely like it's something that it's something. Like, when you do it, you it can guarantee you in the future, like this person, you know, it would be a good connection, and it will be helpful.
26:14
But if you don't do it, but one day when you need it, and you realize, oh, I actually don't have a network and. Uh, like, they're like, you can't make it up. Like, it's a building up process. Uh, thousand percent.
26:37
Actually, I asked a question in the chat before about if the slides will be shared with us. I got no response. All right, that's a bit.
27:31
Excuse me. Do you do you join from? Is San Diego? Do you run? Are you running to joining San Diego?
27:48
Join online! San Diego. Ah, okay, I see. I also feel difficulty to. Make networks. Beer online. So it, I think it's a better to join in San Diego school directory. Especially for talk with Professors. You should join in person. Unfortunately, I I live in a San Jose. Far from San Diego towards from.
28:29
Things you were talking about in the breakout room, importance of making networks, and standing a network. Uh, quality versus quantity. Oh, that's a big one, um, social capital. Yeah, demographics. Wrong, strong connections for Rex, yeah? Challenges intentionality. Networks Network.
28:59
All right, I'm starting to see some common themes here that we're definitely going to get. Step. Whoever's got the noise there. If you wouldn't mind me making sure you mute it. That would help us all that out a lot.
29:21
All right. Is it social networking getting a bit too overwhelming? Yeah. I mean, oh, breaking out of an academic Network. All right, so lots of stuff to talk about, um, some of this. We're going to definitely tap into here. Um. And a lot of a chunk of the issues you're talking about in here is reflecting this truth, which is that the benefits you're going to gain from your network are affected by your network structure and the location of your relational ties in broader networks.
29:55
Oh, I feel I just saw the comment about challenges for being an introvert scientist. Yeah, I feel that a lot of us feel that. Um, if you see me when I'm teaching MBA students, you would not think I was an introvert, but some of this is really painful. Um, but we find ways to get through.
30:12
So, all right, hopefully I'm going to be able to tackle at these. A good chunk of these issues here. And wait. When I'm talking about characteristics of effective networks, we're basically going to talk about three big things. One of them is something that I've already seen getting brought up several times here in the chat, which is the types of context you have.
30:34
In particular, the diversity or breadth of the context in your network. Yeah, even just the comment that came up. Now, how to expand our Network with people from areas that are different to our work? Yep. That's one element of diversity, so we'll be talking about that. Um, we're going to talk about the types of relationships you have in your network, your degree of closeness that you have closeness, or lack of closeness with people in your network, so it's getting into the depth of your social network.
31:06
And the last thing we're going to talk about is the structure, the broader structure of your network itself. In the greater array of relationships out there in the world, and so that's getting into issues of the density of your network and your opportunities for brokerage in your network. Um, all right.
31:26
So? When I bring up breath or diversity? If I say, you know, bringing up the issue of diversity, it's already come up here in the chat. People have this sense. This is something they want. This is something that is a good thing, but I want to remind. Make sure we all think about.
31:45
Why do we care about this? What do we gain from our from having diverse networks? One very obvious thing is, we gain a variety of perspectives. And depending on what you're doing now and what you want to do in the future perspectives can be everything from. A fresh pair of eyes, looking at an idea who can be more critical about it.
32:13
Somebody who's coming from a different field who can say, oh, I have, I can think of some related literature, or I know, somebody who's doing something very similar. Um, perspectives can also be if you're thinking in more of an industry side of things before you bring something out to Market.
32:33
It would help if you had the perspective of a variety of people to get a sense of what customer base to be able to hit. They're all different ways. All kinds of. As we can think about the perspectives, but the more diverse networks we have, the greater variety of perspectives we can get from people.
32:53
Um, diversity is also going to affect the kinds of connections we can make with people. If our Network is not very simple is not very diverse. If it's full of a lot of people who are like us? It becomes even more likely that those people are going to know the same people we do, and so it's going to be a little harder for us to Branch out and meet new people.
33:18
And of course, having a diversity of people that you're interacting with improves things like creativity and Innovation. Because of these different perspectives? Um. So these are all reasons for why, you know, diversity helps. But then, as raises the question of how easy is it, how natural is it for us to, um?
33:46
To have a diverse social network, so I want to give you, uh. Second hole. It's not really a pole. It's more. Let's see, let me, uh, oh. A poll result is being shared. Oh, let me, apparently, I don't know how to stop sharing things there we go. Here we go launching a new poll.
34:07
What is the top determinant? What do you think is the top determinant of whom we form professional and personal relationships with? Is it intelligence attractiveness, similarity, frequency of contact or power and status? You can only pick one. Obviously, all of these play some kind of a role, but one of them tends to come out on top.
35:07
All right. Looks like all right. Looks like most people have responded, we're gonna respond. So let me share the results with y'all. So it looks like we have, uh, almost a dead tie between similarity and frequency of contact. Um, then, so those are kind of neck and neck, according to you folks in terms of what drives.
35:32
The formation of relationships, power, and status is coming into. Third intelligence is up there, and attractiveness is pretty low down. To say, I suspect that the ranking of intelligence and attractiveness affect reflects the academic. Uh, nature of most of audience here, because I have have not had that normally before, but I like it.
35:58
So, you folks thought, similarity, and frequency of contact were the top. Well, it turns out you are half, right? Um, similarity is a top determinant of who we form professional personal relationships with. However, frequency of contact. The funny thing about these things is a lot of these things are into interconnected, so we really like interacting with being around performing relationships with people who are like us.
36:29
One of the and one of the consequences of this is that the way we tend to set up our worlds is we have a tendency to set up our worlds so that we're more likely to be around people who are, like us. So frequency of contact. The people we're most likely to have proximity to.
36:50
Those people tend to be people who are similar to us, so these two things tend to feed off each other. On a side note when it comes to attractiveness, we also have a tendency to find people who are more similar to us to be more attractive. So, this stuff all kind of feeds upon itself.
37:07
Of this issue of similarity. Being the top determinant is that, you know, just a moment ago, I was talking about this issue of diversity, and how important diversity is. If we have this tendency to want to form relationships with people who are similar to us, that tells you that creating diverse networks is something that doesn't necessarily come naturally.
37:33
To us, it is something we have to actively work at. Oh yes, uh, and Tanya makes a nice point about, you know, the pros and cons of similarity? That is definitely true, so I'm not saying we can't interact with people who are similar to us, but it's also important to realize that we also need to Branch out if we're going to, you know, take advantage of all those benefits of having a diverse Network.
38:01
And when I say diversity, it's important to think about diversity. On multiple fronts. So, um, and actually some of the comments I saw in the chat already reflected that some of you already thinking about to what extent do you form connections with people who are more senior than you versus peers versus people who are more Junior than you?
38:24
This is one form of diversity. Um, and as you'll see in a moment, we have certain Tendencies there when we form our networks. Um. There's also how much do we form connections with people who are in our group in our lab? Etc versus outside of our group, our office, our firm, our industry.
38:46
Also within versus outside of our professional specialty and, of course, demographic groups. Are we tending to hang out with people who are seeing gender who are saying, saying, age range? Are we tending to hang out with people who are from our same racial or ethnic group? And thinking about all of these.
39:04
And as you? I can't make hard and fast rules for what the number the numbers should look like for you. But, what's more important to do here is to sit down? Think about the people who are in your social network, which is why I had to do that survey before this class.
39:24
And think about the world you live in. And the people you have potentially access to. And given that context, think about who in your group? Who who is missing in your network, who's over-represented, and who's underrepresented? And keeping all these things in mind. So, to just give you a little sense.
39:52
Of what people in this class. For those of you who are able to complete this, complete the survey in advance, um. Listed an average of 19 people in their social network. The range was from 33 to 50. And to talk about the very classic issue of. Do we hang out with seniors, peers, Juniors?
40:18
About a third of you of, on average, people were listing about a third of the people listing were peers. Uh, but actually the most common connections they were listing were people senior than them. And only on average 12 percent of the people they were listing were Juniors. And I have run this exercise with so many different groups of people so many times.
40:44
And these numbers are I tend to get the same numbers each time around, plus or minus, maybe five percent. Um, oh, Alan, I'll get you. Um, let me get to that question. Alan, in just a moment. So, one thing I want you all to think about. So when I the, for those of you who haven't completed that survey it was.
41:10
It was focused on asking people who's been kind of a help to you in your social network or people you turn to for advice. And that may be part of the reason you tended to list senior people. But I also do think in our lives. We often don't think as much about connecting to people who are more senior than us.
41:31
Um, and one very good reason to do it is. Ask Rosario mentioned in the chat is you can mentor and sponsor Junior people, and that's a great experience. Um, a variety of reasons. But that's not all. One, two other key things to keep in mind when it comes to Junior people is that Junior people can rise and gain power over time, so.
41:59
One grand theme for this class is that networking is a long game. You should be thinking of networking as just forming connections with people. Something you just do in daily life? And you do it without necessarily thinking. Oh, how is this going to pay out right now? You know, these connections can really bear fruit at any point in time in your life.
42:21
So, yeah. So, for example, Junior people you don't know where people are going. You can help them now, and they might be able to help you down the road. And another thing to keep in mind is that Junior people can actually often help you now. People who are more Junior can.
42:43
Provides special kinds of insights. Um, yep. Gain some different insights. I like learning from Junior folks. There you go. Yep. I'm like, I like, people see. We already have people in the channel offering to People's Junior connections. I love this. It's important to so one of the classic examples I like to give.
43:03
So, if you're working in a lab, you've probably already had an experience that sometimes. People had he hit a point in your career where maybe you've read too much, or you sometimes you almost know a little too much about your field and having somebody come in who is fresh.
43:19
They can bring in very unique insights. If you're that's very helpful, another thing that can be very helpful is if you spend a lot of time trying to connect with senior people. Um, and this is particularly true in the business. People when you're trying to connect with senior people.
43:40
Senior people tend to know other senior people, you know, if they're above you, they know other people who are above you. People who are above you are even less likely to be connected with people who are particularly Junior. So, if you're gaining unique insights, unique ideas from people who are more Junior.
44:00
Now, you know, you have these unique ideas, and you have you have? You're bringing very special knowledge to the people who are further above you, so it's this wonderful kind of exchange of ideas. When I T when I've been teaching MBA, sometimes mbas bring this up themselves that when they talk to, you know, when they're connected with more Junior staff.
44:23
They, you know, they're having an ear to the ground and knowing how the more Junior people feel can make them a very valuable to people who are much more senior in a company because the people who are much more senior often have no idea, and they really appreciate finding out without having to do the leg work.
44:48
Oh yeah, that is, uh, if most people we are listing are senior, then those senior folks we were Junior. Well, that is also. This question about whether your senior people are listing you as being part of their Network. That's an interesting question that's going to get into strength of ties, which we'll talk about in just a moment.
45:07
So somebody asked further up this question of how to know? When you have a properly diverse Network, I mean. It's not an easy. It's not an easy question to answer, but I do one thing to do is to keep in mind some of these thinking of some domains. Where do you think it's important that you get a range of people from, such as, in, in your life right now?
45:36
Is? How important would you think it is to talk to people from a range of areas? How important is it for you to talk within your field versus outside of your field? Um, but also keeping it. One other thing to keep in mind is that? Um, we're going to talk one another thread that goes through.
45:55
This is that it's important to think of the network that you need in the future, not just the network you need right now. And one of the things that having a very diverse Network helps you with is it helps you for the future. Um, because for many of us?
46:14
This is not the only job. This is not the one thing we're going to do for the rest of our lives. We are going to do other stuff. Even if we stay perhaps in this particular position. We might start doing different things in this position, or maybe we're going to pick up a side gig.
46:32
Maybe we'll transition in our career where we still technically have the same job, but we're doing a lot of new things. And so making sure we have diversity in our Network helps us in being able in being able to think about what different things we can do and actually being able to make those transitions effectively.
46:53
Um. Okay, I'm gonna ha. I'm not gonna be able to answer all those. Let's see Mentor for junior people. Yeah, offering mentorship to people, it can be potentially tricky. I think the the. The good thing to do is just start out with just getting to know somebody and getting to know what they need.
47:18
Before you start, I think you don't necessarily. For many people, we don't necessarily have a formal statement of, like, hi, I'm going to Mentor you, but it's more a matter of you. Talk to people, and you get to know them, and you see ways where you can provide assistance for them.
47:35
And see, you know, and that that's just kind of a general. This is how we can Network. With anybody, including with Junior people. All right, um, so this is all about diversity. Connecting to this idea. If most people were listing are senior, then those for those senior folks who are Junior.
47:58
Are they not listing us? This gets to this issue of strength of ties. How close is the relationship you have with different people in your social network? And closeness can be measured in a variety of ways. There's three three major ways we talk about is simply the reciprocity of the tie.
48:19
So, do we both see ourselves as being connected? Do I see myself as having a relationship with you as well as you have you seeing us you seeing? You see me, do you see a relationship between us? And, and I do as well. If we both say, yes, there's a relationship here.
48:38
That's a reciprocal relationship. It's kind of the bare minimum for some kind of strength. Then, on top of that, you have the frequency of interaction. How much do you see this person talk to this person? Do things with this person? And then last. Um, there's the degree of trust and interpersonal intimacy that you have with somebody.
49:00
Um. Somebody made a quick comment there in the chat. I was leaving seniority fairly loosey Goose see in terms of definition because. Um. In my, that's going to depend on your field and the country you live in or going to be living in. So, I'm used to being in fields where it's about experience and position.
49:28
But this is me being in Academia with a, you know, a? In the United States, where? Age usually doesn't have as much standing as what your formal role is, and how much experience you have. But I also know that in other countries, seniority can mean something quite different.
49:52
All right. So when we talk about these different aspects of strength of ties, how you know, do you do, we even both agree. You have a connection. How often do you interact, and how deep is that interaction? Is there a lot of trust? Are you talking about things with this person that you don't talk about with many other people or things on more superficial level.
50:13
All of these things combine to indicate the strength of your connection with someone. And we can. Roughly. Talk about how the degree to which we have strong ties. Some people call them allies versus weak ties or acquaintances. Ah, and Natalie is already kind of. She's, um, she's, uh, given away some of the point of what we're going to talk about here with strong versus weave ties.
50:46
Strong versus wheat, strong ties, and weak ties, we are both helpful. They are just helpful in different ways, and the reason I bring it up is it's important for us to know when one would be helpful versus the other. So in this exercise. Because you know, I asked you to think for people off the top of your head who killed particular roles.
51:08
On average, the majority of people you were listing were people. You were very close to and again. This is probably people's reaction when they do this exercise. And it's not surprising, because in the moment you're thinking of people, the people you're very close to are the people you're probably going to think of when you're thinking of.
51:27
Who do I turn to for advice? Things like that? But, of course, we all have a lot of weak ties in our networks, too. Those people can be super helpful. So, for example, um? Granovetter did this very classic study where he looked at how people found jobs. And this took that took, took place in the 70s.
51:52
So let's go back. And I want you to think about in the 1970s. Let's see. Um, in the 1970s. What percentage of managers and professionals found their jobs through personal contacts as opposed to ads or Headhunters? Obviously, the internet is not going to roll here, but what percentage of people were fighting them through personal context?
52:58
All right. Gave you a moment?
53:12
So, it looks like we're kind of stabilizing here. And what people thought was that most people said it was between 51 and 70% of these managers and professionals were finding the jobs through personal contacts. Next, likely answer was greater than 70%. And it turns out. That is right. So, if we look at people who are sort of earlier on in their career?
53:45
You should please stop sharing that bull stop sharing pool. There we go. So, yeah, this is. This is a study from 1973. And we'll get to the separate issue of how relevant is this still? Now, you might guess it might still be relevant if I'm talking about it with you guys.
54:06
Uh, um, so? Vast majority of majority of people are finding their jobs through personal context. What was particularly interesting? For granovetter was the second question, who are they finding these jobs through? Okay, come on there we go. And in particular, he was entrusted in this question of. Were people finding this these people.
54:37
These, um? Excuse me jobs through acquaintances or weak ties or friends and family strong ties.
55:22
All right. Um, looks like we kind of settled in here. This one was a toughy for you, folks. This was people were kind of neck and neck here on the possibilities.
55:41
So? A slight majority of you thought that it was friends and family that people were finding these jobs for you. But it turns out that actually. People were finding these jobs through most. The time people were finding these jobs through weak ties through people that they saw very rarely to be precise.
56:04
That's how we figured out weak ties. Um. Yes, so weak ties. Yes, there are many, yeah. The internet was not invented yet.
56:20
But in particular, the reason weak ties were so helpful here. Was that weak ties provided novel information for people? So if people you know? When people were trying to have their friends and family help them out. These are people that are close to. They tend to run in the same Social Circles.
56:38
Those people knew about job jobs that the managers and professionals already knew about it was the weak ties, who would give them unique pieces of information. And that helped them. Yo, find jobs. Now, and this comes down to a fundamental difference between weak ties and strong ties, which I think some of you have already been hashing out in the chat.
57:06
Um, the thing about weak ties their strength is that they give you more diverse and non-redundant information. These weak ties, the people you see once or twice a year. The people you only talk to. Occasionally, they are living in a world that you're not generally part of, so they know different stuff.
57:28
And this is a way for you to find out that different stuff. On the flip side, strong ties. Because you have this strong connection with them, they're more willing to provide substantial help and support the weak ties. Okay, so I told you about the ground. I've had to study as as many people hashed out in the chat.
57:49
This is from the '70s. Does this matter now, um? You know? For those. I was born in the 70s, um, so I did not go through the job market then, but you know, I saw the job market pre-2000s, you know? I know of things like newspaper ads. And things like that.
58:12
Um, there was no monster.com. There was no indeed, etc, etc, etc it is so much easier to find information about job openings now. And many more people apply to a given job than ever used to be true. And if any of you guys have been on search committees or hiring committees, you're painfully aware of this.
58:32
The number of applications you get now that Google can transmit them online instead of putting them in the mail is a crazy town. So then, that raises the question of if we have the answer. If we have all these other possibilities our weak ties still, the most helpful thing for us.
58:54
Um, and I'll tell you somebody actually did some interesting research about this. So, this paper came out just a few years ago. And they took advantage of something called the people you may know. Option in LinkedIn, so LinkedIn. Would randomly vary the recommendations of people you may need to know to their to the the people, uh, to those of us using LinkedIn.
59:26
And these researchers realized that LinkedIn had been randomly. For years. And so they harness that data. To see, so they treated this data as a way that people. Weak and strong ties would be experimentally varied. So it turns out if you have if more of the people and the people you may know recommendation are people that don't have any connections with you.
59:55
Um, so you know when the people you may know thing comes up in LinkedIn? People have a tendency to click through at least some of those people. So, if you have several people listed there who don't have many Mutual connections with you. That means that you're you're going to be.
01:00:10
You're still going to be likely to click on at least some of them. That means your number of weak ties are going to go up. If, however, it turns out, you're having a bunch of people listed who have a bunch of mutual connections. You're still going to be likely to click on them, but now your number is of strong ties in your network are going to go up, so they use the size this real life natural experiment.
01:00:36
And they looked at the data. Um, and I know the. The, you know, it's. It's not the most perfect way of studying this, but it was a really nice, real life manipulation of who's in people's social networks. Um. And then they looked at okay. They actually looked at people.
01:00:59
They looked at the weak and strong ties that have been recommended to them, and they looked down the road whether or not people change jobs, and in particular, whether or not people change jobs for somebody jobs to somebody who they actually. We're connected to in their social network. So, it's, you know, your likelihood of switching jobs?
01:01:23
To a job at a company where somebody your social network is at that same company. Um, and they looked at the likelihood of that happening, depending on whether that person you are connected to. Was was somebody who was a weak tie, or somebody was a strong tie so? Um, and what they found was that, just like what grandma better found way back in the '70s, was that relatively weaker ties led to the greatest increase in job mobility, so adding a moderately weak tie, increased job applications, and job transmission the most.
01:02:00
And adding a strong touch job application and job transmission, the least and job transmission means you get a job at the place where your new connection works. So, for those of you who like graphs Heroes. A lovely graph where you can sort of see here that. The number of mutual friends is on the x-axis.
01:02:28
So you can think of an individual friends as a proxy of how we control your connection is with this person, assuming that the mo, the more mutual friends you have. You can see, there's kind of this peak. Around. Let's see, I don't really want Anna Tate. Okay, I'm not even gonna try using these tools.
01:02:58
Oh, maybe I'll just use this. Yeah, go back to the mouse where you can see. There's a peak here when somebody has around 10 mutual friends with you. You're most likely to end up getting a job later. At this, any ties company? So, this is just some nice real.
01:03:17
Well, yeah, the probability of job transmission. So, keep in mind when they, you know, they took them. They, they got access to a ton of data for LinkedIn. The likelihood that these people were actually looking for jobs is probably pretty low, given that they were looking. This is just this is not pre-selecting on whether people were looking for jobs or not.
01:03:38
This is just scraping a ton of data of people who are on LinkedIn. So, yeah, people are, you know, in a given period of time, most people are not switching jobs. Of people's likelihood is going up likely to get a job at a company is going up when you have this kind of.
01:03:59
Weak connection to somebody who has a job there who already has a job at that company. And so again. Um. What you see here is this idea. We often think about our week. We don't. We often don't think about our weak times very much, or we often may be worried about, should we be trying to turn every week?
01:04:23
Ty into a strong tie. Um, you do not need to turn every week tie into a in your social network into a strong tie, um. You don't have bandwidth to do that, and I think many of you already realize that probably. Weak time. Serve a purpose. They provide more diverse and non-redundant information than strong ties.
01:04:46
And it's helpful to have these weak ties because it helps you grow in New Directions. It helps you change career paths. Weak ties are often what make our Network our future facing. Um.
01:05:03
Um, and then, yes, let's see, many folks. Let's try applying for part-time positions, so I'm at more weak ties to better. It isn't necessarily that the more weak ties you have, the better. The reality is, many of us have a lot. Most of us have a lot of weak ties.
01:05:19
It's just that we forget these people who exist if I, if you actually sat down and thought, and you made yourself think for a while about. Let me think in the last year who have you had more than a handful of conversations with? Is there somebody if you go to conferences regularly?
01:05:36
Is there a set of people who you always talk to at conferences, but perhaps you don't really talk to them outside of conferences? Um, these are all sorts of things. Are there people in your neighborhood where you run into them periodically? You say, hi, you chit chat. But you don't necessarily start, you know, inviting each other out to dinner like there.
01:05:59
Our world is full. Our worlds are full of weak ties. And part of this is simply realizing. Ooh, these weak ties are in the world and realizing that these people can be a great resource for certain kinds of things. Um. Because. The week ties are the source of new information.
01:06:25
Something I want to emphasize here is that you notice when we're talking about what weak ties are useful for. I'm not saying that a weak tie is going to be a great resource if you want to ask for a letter of recommendation. Or if somebody is going to vouch for your work skills.
01:06:45
Um, these are things that weak times are not good for. Weak ties are a great source for information. If you want to ask somebody for substantial help for substantial support. Um. Oh, and somebody somebody brings up that they've got people that fall in between weak and strong ties. Obviously, what we're talking about here is a Continuum talking about weak versus strong is just, uh, helpful, shorthand, but it's important.
01:07:12
It's good to think about this more of a Continuum and think about, you know? What sort of things you can do for yourself of two for your social network and also what sort of things you could ask for for your social network. If you don't have a strong connection with somebody.
01:07:29
It's not gonna go very well if you ask them to put in a good word for you for a job because they don't know you. They don't know if they can trust you. They don't know if you, you know, do a good job job. But, you know, those are the things your strong ties are good for, you know, making a personal recommendation.
01:07:52
Um, if you need to get complicated or sensitive information from somebody. If you want to find out the T about what's going on a particular company or in a particular lab, that's what the strong ties are useful for. Um. And so. Yeah, so thinking about these things? According. Okay, let me go back to this according to the graph.
01:08:18
Why does the opportunity get a job after 10 to 15? Ties actually decrease. So, going back to this graph, something to keep in mind with this particular study again, they didn't screen for because this is a massive, you know, this is a big data. Kind of data dump situation here.
01:08:42
We don't know how many of these people are actually trying to get jobs at different companies or things like that. Um, but the idea here is that? Um, having a weak connection might give you some novel information or insight into the fact that there's a job opening in a particular company.
01:09:05
Um. Having a bunch of, you know? Um, I think one thing to notice is that there's a big amount of variance when you get to people who are very strong ties where you have a lot of mutual connections, mutual friends. I'm any guess that what's happens with some of those straw with the people who are really on the strong tie-in.
01:09:25
Sometimes the strong tie can help you is is helping you get a job because they're going to provide a personal recommendation. Um. So they're actually going to be extra mile for you, but you have these people who are kind of in betweeners, which I, you know, people were concerned and were wondering about.
01:09:44
I don't think these people are. These people aren't necessarily inhibiting you from getting a job, but it's just that they're not going to necessarily provide you with information you didn't already know so. Adding that person to your network isn't adding novel information. And that's, that's what this graph is really about.
01:10:08
That adding somebody who already knows a bunch of people, you already know, this kind of swims in the same circles that you do. They're not providing any information, which is why they're not giving you a kind of boost in terms of getting a job, like somebody who is a bit more novel, is giving you.
01:10:29
So, that's what's going on there. So, yeah. So, and none of these are actually making you. You're never getting a like, oh, now, you're actively, you're. You're less likely to get a job when you've added this person. All right, so this is his whole idea. So one of the key things, I hope you take away from this idea of strong and weak ties.
01:10:53
Is, we're often very aware of our strong ties, and we often utilize our strong ties. And they're very important, but it's also important to be aware of the people we're weakly connected with, because those people can provide us with wonderful sources of information as well, and it often doesn't hurt to reach out to those people when you have questions.
01:11:14
When you want to find things out as long as you're not asking questions that are very sensitive? Reach out to people. Um, and another thing. I want to put out there. Is this idea of the power of dormant ties, so I know people are in this? In this room are coming from a variety of Ages, a variety of stages in your career.
01:11:44
But even for those who are on the younger side, you may have already noticed that there are people you use to be connected with in your life that you don't really talk to anymore. And. A variety of Studies have suggested that we actively maintain only about 100 to 200 ties at a time.
01:12:01
In fact, some of you might be familiar with this idea of dunbar's number, where it's been. Some people have suggested that this might be evolutionarily perhaps even neurologically based. I'm not going to hang my hat on that, but it does seem we have a tendency where it's hard for us to connect with more than 200 people at a time, and mind you, I'm not even saying that all 200 people.
01:12:29
I'm not even saying all 200 people are people we're close with. Adding some kind of active connection 200 is kind of seems to be our upper limit. Um. And so that raises this issue of if we're only able to maintain about 100 200 connections, but we live our lives.
01:12:47
We move to new places we do different things. We connect with people. And then we fall out of touch. Another question is, does it pay to reconnect with people? And this is this idea of dormant ties, and there are some organizational behavior researchers who decided to study this. They actually.
01:13:12
Took a group of Executive MBA students. And they asked them to react with two people with robotics in the past three years. They were supposed to think of people that might have advised on some sort of major ongoing work project they had. So they so all of these Executive mbas were asked to connect with two people that they hadn't communicated with for three years about a project.
01:13:38
And they were also asked to consult with two current ties about the project. And then the question is okay, so you're talking to two people. You have to talk to for at least 3 years and two people. You're in more regular connection with. Hmm, who's gonna provide the best advice?
01:14:03
And what they found was that actually it was. Those dormant tie is, mind you, this is, I know, this is self-report on scales. This is the best we have to work with us for the study. Um. But these Executive MBA and students found that. They felt that the dormant ties provided more unexpected insights.
01:14:28
Um, or advice. And they really felt like the dormant ties delivered more. So? And another important aspect of this is that, as you might imagine, so this was done in the context of a class setting, um. They got informed consent. Don't worry. But um, as you might imagine, some of these Executive mbas.
01:14:54
I had some definite reticence about doing this whole dormant tie thing, reconnecting people with people after a few years. But they were really happy to find what they did. People, the trust levels, the sense of connection came back very quickly.
01:15:17
And so something? So, this is something I want you to realize. Is that the benefits of hoops, the benefits of connecting back with dormant ties? Is, there's two key things you get. Over current ties, one is you tend to get more novel information. Um, and one thing about that, that novel and the the reason you're getting novel information is the same reason that weak ties provide malleable information.
01:15:45
Dormant ties are people who've been doing a bunch of other stuff for a while. They've been, you know, living in other worlds that you're not a part of, they're going to bring A New Perspective to the table, which is super helpful. Interestingly, the advantage they provide over the week going after a week tie is that you have trust and shared understanding with the dormant tie.
01:16:10
A dormant tie is somebody you already have a connection with. Those connections tend to come back. Um, which also makes it easier to reconnect with a dormant tie to get a new perspective as opposed to trying to connect with somebody new. You already have the trust and shared understanding, but since you haven't talked for a while.
01:16:33
They're bringing a novel perspective. And so something I think is important to think about is how you can incorporate this kind of reconnection into your routine. I'm not saying you need to be contacting everybody all the time. You should if you ever have. If you're ever working on something thinking about something?
01:16:59
And you pause. And you think, oh, you know, I haven't talked to so. And so, in years, if that person would be, I think they'd bring some interesting insights to the table. Go with that. Connect with that person. Talk to them about this, probably going to get some very interesting insights, um.
01:17:22
As long. I mean, if you one thing I should mention, is that that if you, if you have a dormant tie because? Um, because you had a fight or or conflict, that's a different issue. That's a very different issue that we're not addressing here, but this is just if it's a matter of just losing touch with somebody.
01:17:44
Feel free to reconnect with them if you're working on something, and you think they'd be able to bring a new perspective to the table. Do it. All right.
01:17:59
I'm not saying you, so people have questions about whether to do. I'm not saying you hadn't, I'm going to throw in a lot of possibilities of things to do. I don't think you have to reconnect with dormant ties all the time, but I think I think something to keep in mind is that you can let a tie stay dormant.
01:18:18
I'm not saying you have to necessarily connect with this person all these people every year. Um, though you could choose to. But one thing I definitely think is important. Advice is that it's good to be aware of the people the dormant ties that might. Be useful in a situation you're in right now.
01:18:42
Yeah, and if you have a dormant time, you think they'd be useful. You think they'd be able to bring unique insight? Feel free feel comfortable to reconnect with them. It is very likely to be highly beneficial for the both of you. So, that's what I'm thinking about here. Um.
01:19:03
One thing I, as we talk about all this stuff with, you know, strength of ties, things like that. Um, the answer for handling your social network well is not necessarily to just keep adding connections and keep deepening connections. Um, because human beings have you folks only have so much time.
01:19:27
We only have so much energy. Um. A lot of what I'm talking about here is thinking about things in a strategic way and being aware of what. Who can provide which kinds of help for you who you can be helpful for and thinking about things in a bit more of a strategic fashion?
01:19:49
Which actually brings me? My third topic, which is the third characteristic, which is density and brokerage. So one of the ways? We add value to the world is by connecting to and being able to connect other people to different worlds. And so this goes back to the idea of this is not strictly a numbers game.
01:20:12
On. So, this is, I just thrown up a bunch of social networks here. If you go from your your left side to your right side. You can see both the networks on the top and the network on the bottom. The networks on the bottom are adding information sources. You know, you start out with the far left.
01:20:31
Networks are both full cursor networks, and the middle networks have eight people in them. Char the networks on the right have 16. These are the same number of connections. But notice there is a critical difference if you look at the networks on the top. There's. A lot of you're connecting to 16 people eventually from four to eight to 16.
01:21:08
But a lot of those people you're adding are people who are also connected to each other. Whereas in the networks up the bottom? You are connecting directly. To only four people, and then indirectly to a bunch of other people. Um. And what this stuff emphasizes here is that when you're directly connecting to more people, it doesn't always give you more information.
01:21:39
Like, really. In essence, if you looking at the top the networks a, b, and c. You're really getting the same amount of information each Network because the new people you're adding that are direct connections to you. These are people who are also all talking to each other. So there's a lot of redundancy.
01:22:00
Um, whereas with the networks a Prime, B Prime, and C Prime at the bottom, you're adding people, but they're indirect connections. Um, and so now, you're able to get more information from indirectly through the four people you are connected with. So, this is getting to this idea of density.
01:22:24
Um, which that was calculated, um? Uh, we need you all right. This is connecting is the idea of density, which is the proportion of people in your network that are also connected to each other. And so what I had to do the network exercise you listed. All these people you had this wonderful Excel spreadsheet, or I should say, spreadsheet not actually accelerated.
01:22:52
And then you indicated which people knew each other. And from that, you can calculate a density score. So, a score of one or a hundred percent means every single person is also connected to every to all the other people. Zero means each person is only connected to you. And the average density.
01:23:17
In your social networks was about 22%. So the networks that you came in. This gives you the. Gives you a course representation. It's a course histogram. So you can get a sense. Of what the distribution of density was in your social networks?
01:23:40
So actually, um, this is interesting because it keeps. The degree to which people are thinking of dance versus disconnected social networks has been changing over time in the pandemic has really created a big shift in this. Um. Key thing I want to emphasize here yet again. There is no one correct answer.
01:24:03
What the appropriate amount of density is in a man of work, but what I want you thinking about is what these different kinds of networks. So, when you have a low amount of density, that means you have a disconnected Network. A high amount of density means you have a dense Network.
01:24:23
So, I want you to think about what these kinds of network structures. Provide for you, what they provide, what they don't provide, what they're good for. What they're bad for. Um, so 0.17 distance 17 yeah, all right. So when you have a dense Network when you for folks who had 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, maybe even zero point?
01:24:51
0.6 might fall into this category, too. That's a network that's relative to dense. Ma, you know you're connected to people and those people are tending to be very interconnected to each other, like, what's going on with Bill here? When we have a dense Network, what does that mean? What does that do for us?
01:25:10
Well. By definition, it consists of mainly Mutual redundant ties. One thing having a dense Network does is it increases this trust. We all know each other. We all talk to each other. We all interact with each other. It's, you know, it creates a very trusting environment. One of the reasons, frankly, that it increased trust is that it helps create and preserve reputations.
01:25:45
Um, and you can think about this very practically pick one of the nodes in builds Network. Imagine Bill does something really shady? Maybe Bill steals the ID? Maybe this is Bill's Network at his workplace and Bill's steals? The idea from one of these people he's connected to, and he passes it off as his own.
01:26:11
You can think about how quickly is the information that bill stole this idea. Going to pass through the social network? It's gonna travel very quickly. As a result, you know, very quickly, everyone else in that social network is going to find out that builded something nasty and dirty. His reputation is going to take a nose drive.
01:26:33
You can think of a similar effect of build with something very kind, very helpful, etc, etc. Um. So, having a dense Network means that reputations are easily created, and they stick around. Cuz everybody people know each other's business, frankly. Um. Part of the reason this reputation stuff happens is because dense networks allow for easier coordination and communication.
01:27:05
Because all these people are interconnected, there's many channels through which information can pass. And networks like this are very, very stable. Um. You can imagine in a situation like this. What if this is, like, I said if this, if we imagine that this is Bill's workplace network? What happens if Bill retires and moves to another country?
01:27:33
And decides to live off the grid. Well, if you remove Bill from this social network. People will be sad. They'll do a lovely going away party for him. But you can see that the connections between everybody are still pretty much preserved everybody because there are so many other connections connecting people in the social network removing bill from it.
01:28:01
Isn't gonna? Destroy the network itself. It's not going to fall apart. Yes, also very interesting that bill retires the rest of the team's fine for his position. That's that's a, that's a side note. But yeah, so these kinds of dense networks are stable. And if you're thinking about, you know when dense networks?
01:28:24
This is very common in Friendship circles. It's a little less common in other environments, but friend networks tend to be fairly dense. Um, now the other side. If you had a network if you had a density, which was, you know 0.1, 0.82, 0.3, maybe maybe 0.4, but more? Yeah.
01:28:50
This is more of a disconnected Network, like what Liz has here? Where she's got, you know, she's connected to various people. Some of these people are connected to each other, but most of them. Now! Because you have, you know, this disconnection? By definition, it consists of mainly exclusive, non-redundant ties.
01:29:14
One of the consequences of it. Is that you have more freedom from reputation effects, so if Liz? Would pull the same sort of shenanigans like Bill did, where she steals some of these idea. And passes it off its own. You can think about how well is that information going to travel in her social network.
01:29:38
How quickly is that going to travel? It's not really gonna travel very well. So, this is, you know, it's a little harder to pre just to create a reputation. And it's, well, actually, I should say it's actually hard to create a reputation in a disconnected Network. Um, people, the information people have about you.
01:30:04
They're mostly gaining from you from interacting with you directly because they don't really know what the people interact with you. Now you can think about how this can be an advantage, but it can also be. This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. It's going to be harder for you to create trust in a network that's fairly disconnected.
01:30:28
Because people people what people know about you is mostly limited to what they're experiencing firsthand from interacting with you. They're not getting other information from other people about you, so it's gonna be a bit harder to build trust in a situation. Um, but a big benefit of disconnect to networks is you're going to get more access to non-redundant, diverse information and entrepreneurial opportunities.
01:30:57
There is this reality that if you have a bunch of people who are generous if you're connected to a bunch of people? Who aren't connected to each other. They're probably existing in very different worlds. They're doing different things. By definition, they're talking to different people. That means they're more likely to bring new information to the table.
01:31:21
You can contrast this with the dense Network. The dense Network, because all the people you're connected with are also talking to each other. It is very likely their existing in very similar environments. They're not. They're much less likely to get. Nation. So? One of the benefits a disconnected network is this information about?
01:31:51
Uh, another benefit of disconnected network is that? You as somebody. Since you are connecting people since you are the one being connected, people who are not normally connected. You have some extra control over any information and resources, and you can kind of dictate who knows. Who finds out about what, who knows about what we'll get more to that issue in a moment?
01:32:19
Now, the disconnected network is also a very flexible Network, which would be a good thing or a bad thing. If you look at Liz's Network, imagine Liz is retiring now. Moving to another country living off the grid? You can see that if Liz leaves most of the people in her network are no longer going to be even indirectly connected to each other, so the network falls apart.
01:32:46
So, this is very, it's, you know, it's a very different setup from Advanced Network. So, walking through all this stuff here, I want to highlight. It's not that dense networks are good or and disconnected ones are bad or vice versa. It's that they each bring unique pros and cons to the table.
01:33:08
Um. One position that does tend to be particularly powerful, though, is this idea of a broker? Which I was already talking a little bit with Liz. In this graph highlight this bigger highlights. It is a broker Bridges a structural hole between groups. A broker is somebody who connects groups who would otherwise not be connected without this person.
01:33:36
And you might have also heard bridge is another term. Sometimes people use for this. And. A broker is a particularly powerful and useful role to be in. Um, and somebody he here was, I think I think I saw somebody very casually bring up six degrees of separation. I don't know how many of you actually know where the whole concept of six degrees of separation came from.
01:34:04
It's not just a play. It's not just a movie, um, it's had it, did it over tonight with Kevin Bacon. If you got, if anybody knows something bacon? But it actually originated from way back in the 60s. Yes, I like to give my classic studies. Um, from Stanley Milgram, Stanley Milgram.
01:34:25
That name sounds familiar to you. This is the same person who did the research with whether or not, people would be willing to get electric shocks to other people in the context of learning. Um, experiment. But he did not just do electric shock studies. He also had this question about how small is the world we live.
01:34:46
So? He did study. Where he took his thumb up, and he selected 160, a filbert from Omaha, Nebraska. Because yes, this is back in the days, uh, Big Yellow Pages regards a phone book picks out 160 residents of Omaha, Nebraska, at Randall. And he Nails them a packet. And in this packet, they are given the name and address of a stock broker who worked in Boston and lived in Sharon, Massachusetts.
01:35:21
So they gave him the address of the place where the software works and the address of what the stock. Actually, I don't think they actually, I don't think they actually gave him the advocacy. They just gave them the cities, and they said, here's a stock broker. Here's the guy's name works in Boston works in Sharon, Massachusetts.
01:35:38
And each of these people were asked. Take this packet and send it to somebody that they know somebody they know in a first name basis. That they thought would get it closer to the stock growth. Yes, this is kind of. Owacky. Environment. You can imagine a wacky thing to get.
01:36:05
And then they wrote their name and roster to kind of keep track of how many people they had to. Hey, they had to go through. Um, most of these trains didn't complete. And you know, this was just through the postal mail. All they know is which packages actually got to the stock broker.
01:36:22
We have no idea why the chains didn't complete. It is very likely that a Chinese residents who got the packet thought this is really weird and threw it away and did nothing with it. Of the 44 chains that did complete. Most of those letters. The average number of steps the letters had to take to get to reach the stock broker was six, and this is where we came up from six degrees of separation.
01:36:51
I know, this feels totally random. But there is a reason I'm bringing this up. The reason I'm bringing this up is that there were 44 packets I completed. 24 of them reach the stunt broker at home. And 16 of those were given to him by one person. Jacobs, who is a clothing merchant.
01:37:14
The remaining ones were sent to his office, and of those, the majority came through just two men. So, we started out with this. Random array of people from Omaha, Nebraska, and somehow. And it's only a, you know, a subset of people a subset of the chains that were completed, but half of those that were completed?
01:37:37
The last step. Was through one of three people. And this is where we get. How this whole idea of brokerage. So there's a small amount very small people number in the world that are linked to everyone else in just a few steps, and those people are Brokers and the rest of us are linked to The Wider world through these few.
01:38:03
Is the power of brokerage? And when I say Brokers a powerful, it's not only that the powerful, but they also have great potential to help other people when you're a broker when you connect a bunch of disparate groups that are not normally connected? You access to Unique resources and diverse non-redundant info.
01:38:26
You can share that info with the different groups you know you found information from one group. You can share it with another group you find out information from one individual you can share with other individuals, and you're also able to connect a variety of people. If you've ever had a moment where somebody's talking to you and they're talking about a problem, they have.
01:38:50
And you think, and it makes you think of somebody in a very different part of your life. Who might be able to help them? The fact that you can now connect those two people. This means in that. In that moment, you're acting as a broker. And it's this awesome, powerful, really helpful space to be in.
01:39:11
Yes, there's I see the the idea of super connector in there. Um, that was the term I think was Malcolm Gladwell, who used that one. Um, and there's if you're interested in the science behind this, Ron Bert, who I think he has not retired yet. He's at University of Chicago.
01:39:32
He's done a million. Uh, studies looking at Brokers in the workplace, they all there's like, there's way too many graphs. There's a, there's a joke amongst those of us who teach about social networks that there is a roughly a million graphs you can show about the power of brokerage, and they also show the same thing.
01:39:54
Um, this is, it's a little convoluted. But the numbers on the bottom are a calculation. That takes your social network and calculates, um. Brokerage opportunities you have in your network. So, for some reason, it's scaled so that higher numbers are less brokerage, fewer brokerage opportunities. And so, the graph on the left is the quality of the ideas people generated.
01:40:24
In one particular study, the graph on the right is about people. And they created a performance score, which was combining performance evaluations, people's compensation, people's likelihood of getting promoted. And it's all basically the same pattern, the. Uh, more broke, which opportunities the network, the better you're performing the better ideas you're coming up with.
01:40:48
The more creative you are, there's like a million positive things about it. Brokerage is a powerful position to be in. Um, what it well? Let me see. What did they do to come up with the good idea? That is an excellent question. I'd have to go back to the original study, um.
01:41:09
This was a supply chain managers in a large electronics firm, so I'm not sure about that for this one study, but they've found similar effects in a variety of studies. So, it is. It's the power of The Brokerage brokerage leading to positive outcomes is a really robust effect. Um.
01:41:30
Which, of course, suggests that one thing I'm seem to be saying. You should go and try to be a broker. I think that is generally a good idea of being aware of your brokerage opportunities. People, you know, for many of you, it's probably not hard. To think of your brokerage opportunities because?
01:41:49
You have somebody is raising their hand. Hello, oh, are we're way over, huh? Uh-Oh, I just realized that I'm so sorry. Don't worry, this has been so fantastic. I think we all less track of time, but I just wanted to to just provide a gentle reminder, but thank you okay, let me just I'll let you take it from here, pointing out a few key things.
01:42:17
Yeah, so. You want to think about. Do you care more about trust? Do you care about more about interesting information? I'm sorry, folks. I went way over. Thank you so much for your patience with me. And thank you for all your great ideas from the chat. Um, we'll be posting the slides online, right?
01:42:40
Ucsd are micro MBA people. We're going to post the slides online. Yes, okay, thumbs up perfect. All right, thank you so much.
01:42:53
Thank you so much, Pamela. Recording stopped. Thank you. That was an awesome lecture! Thank you, thank you! Amazing! So interesting, thank you so much. Yeah, thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

01:08
Can everyone hear me? Yes, sounds good. Okay.
01:41
Um.
02:39
How many people really have? We are at about 160 yeah.
02:53
Okay, some reason I can't see participants when I share the screen. Was the problem last time? Yeah, I have that happen as well. Um, on screen, share a lot of the host. Tools disappear so, but we're at 164 right now. Try to.
03:24
Okay, I got it now.
03:31
Okay, this is better. Um.
03:39
Yeah, so one one, uh, kind of housekeeping. I'm going to show about four videos today. So, uh, you probably need your sound on to get the full experience and. Hopefully, the sharing will work for some reason. I'll have to switch switch screens. I'm sharing and stuff like that because the embedding in the PowerPoint didn't work.
04:02
But other than that, they think we should be fine. Are we good to go? We have 177.
04:14
Okay. Um. So welcome! Again, everybody. We're in part two of the three hour. Um, kind of quick dive into strategic marketing. Uh, just a reminder we mostly focused on. What is marketing value proposition and segmentation? Targeting and positioning last time? Um. The reason I decided to focus on. That is because if you take one thing from this and you remember positioning.
04:44
Then, then I've done my job, uh? Everything else kind of follows from positioning both strategy and tactics. Um, so if that's if you get that, that's great. And it really, my, my goal is to change the way you think about this. Um, and then just a reminder. This was sort of the entire marketing framework, and last time we talked about the the top part that ended in the segmentation already positioning point.
05:14
And I talked about what follows, and today we're going to talk about branding, which is. Directly follows from positioning, and it's one of the tools kind of in the in the hand of. Companies, the marketer, or whoever in order to accomplish the goals that you set out with a strategy.
05:35
Um, and it's kind of a special tool, so I'm focusing on it, but I'm mostly focus on it because it helps kind of crystallize and reinforce what we talked about last time. Um, and so. I'm going to start with two examples. Uh, from two companies that. I hope most of, you know?
05:56
Uh, someone asked. Everyone able to hear, I hope. That's a yes. If you see me talking and nothing comes out, then then. Let us know, um. Okay, so. The first one. First example, I'm going to use as sort of preview for what we're going to talk about. Is hashtag opt outside?
06:21
How many of you have heard about this or know what this is about?
06:32
Okay. There's a few yeses, but a majority. No, okay, so I'll give. I'll give a little bit more background. But let me start. With the background. Let me show you a video, so let me, uh. How do I switch which screen I'm sharing? I'll stop, share, and then share.
06:53
Um. This screen. Let me know if you can see this. Can you see kind of a big black screen? Hopefully. Yes, yes, okay. I'm going to play this. How do I play this video?
07:18
In the news tonight. Another Black Friday has arrived opening their doors earlier this year. It was a krx.
07:38
Taking a stand against the Black Friday frenzy, a major retailer is refusing to open on Black Friday this year. Retailer REI, all of its locations will be closed on Black Friday, and it won't be processing any sales online. It will pay employees to take Black Friday off to spend time Outdoors.
08:21
This Black Friday, we're closing all 143 of our stores.
08:33
You better be in the mountains than the Isles. Join us on November 27th at Option outside.
09:01
More retailers are joining REI, deciding to close their doors on Black Friday.
09:46
Okay. What did you guys think about? What we just saw? You can either again remind you. You can either write in the text. You could either speak whatever kind of works for you.
10:13
A professor if I may? Uh, Melanie from the ebt's office. I, um, I found it inspiring, but it's interesting how easy it feels easy to sway public, um. By doing by by making some radical statement, because then others jumped in. Um, on something that was so heavily popular for a long time.
10:41
I agree and disagree. I don't know that it's easy to sway the public. I think if you do things right, you can win. Body requires doing things right. Um. So someone says smart marketing, but I wonder if they made more money? So, again, you're taking a huge risk, right?
10:59
You're going to be closed. Both offline in the brick and mortar world and online. You're not going to sell on the biggest retail day. Right, that is a huge. Right? It's, um. And. And the question is? What's the ROI on something like this? What's what's the benefit?
11:30
So someone said it increased brand meaningfulness and and. Uh, brand love, I assume we don't. We don't yet know what we mean by brand, but yeah, maybe. Um. And they're trying to add value to. The consumer saying, you're more than just somebody who goes and consumes and buys stuff, you know, get out and enjoy life, so they're trying to add value to the consumer, and I by doing that.
11:58
I think they're trying to add value to their brand because. It's pretty Noble. Yeah, and you know, again, if you measure success in in social media Impressions? Like, you couldn't buy 6.7 billion Impressions. Right, it's just like. But, but does it translate to to benefits to the, you know, to the company and shareholders, and whatever, and stuff like that?
12:24
Arya is a co-op, so shareholders easier. But um? But it's, it's definitely a, you know, a bold move? And a costly one. Right. So, for example, for companies to say stuff. Often. Is perceived by people or maybe perceived as cheap talk. Right? Everybody can say stuff. Now you can say, just do it, but what does it mean?
12:48
Bye, um. Yeah, so, so this is. This is an interesting one. Interestingly, in my UCSD email. I got an email before that. It is going to happen. Advice, so it's not a surprise. They told people ahead of time. And they also told me kind of. Where should I go in the San Diego area?
13:10
Here are a couple of recommendations. Uh, for example, if you haven't been, go to potato, cheap Rock, and stuff like that. Um. So? There's work that goes into this to do this, right? I don't know if you caught this, but at the end, they're like. And if you have, you know, if you need to carry your Thanksgiving leftovers with?
13:36
We have these boxes. You could get to do that. Um. And. They. So good. With this, they start doing it every year. And they are still doing it by the way. Um. So this was, you know? 2017 was the third year they did it. This is something from Fortune.
14:01
Um. The CEO, by the way, who is actually the guy sitting there in the in the task Outdoors? Um. Basically. Says you, you don't promote your way to love, right? You just have to do real stuff. It's about being a different kind of company, so these are bold statements and.
14:24
And clearly I see. I hope we all agree that it's not directly selling us products, right? They're investing in something else, and they hope this would pay off so. In conjunction with this, they also ran kind of the following ad that I'll show you just to make you see kind of how they perceive this.
14:45
Um, let me. And share the right thing.
14:54
It's. Let's go to this one. This is the ad they read. They ran at the same time. One, two, one, two, three.
16:11
So, what do we think of this? What's? What's the message in this ad? We have the stuff that you need to be outdoors.
16:34
Uh, kind of, uh, emphasizes the idea that to be outside is a very happy experience. Yeah, and is there one form of outside? No, no, you've got water. Uh, the forest, uh, Trails, mountain biking? Like everything, right? Everything and everyone is depicted in that. Um. Again, they're not focusing on a particular product.
17:02
Clearly, we see products. Right, but the message is indirect, and that's that's important. We can talk about that if you want. Um. Yeah, these are products. I mean, you can buy these products not only in REI, right? So, that's. They're not. It's not like a particular product from REI.
17:23
It's more about someone wrote it's more about the lifestyle. And it's more about this is for everybody. And I agree, and this is this is done in a fun way. Yeah, I agree. They are kind of selling the happy moment rather than the products itself. Yeah, so although I, I wonder because?
17:45
They, essentially, the people who they're targeting are people who probably spend their time outside anyway. I mean, generally, people who would buy REI products or go to REI or are already kind of outdoorsy people, so I wonder. What their thought was about. Were they going to try and convert some people from being those Black Friday consumers to embracing a new lifestyle where REI is a key part of that?
18:20
I, I kind of think it's actually the opposite. I think they're targeting people that are not. Rei consumers, because before someone can be an REI consumer, they have to want to go outside, right, and like, have a reason to use said products. And I think somebody said it in the comments, but it's like.
18:39
It's kind of like you can't. You can't sell Fitness wear to somebody who's not active, and so you have to like being active really attractive to that person, and then once they have that Association, they'll associate your brand heavily with it. So, I think it's actually a mass marketing, um.
18:54
Move, and more like a brand awareness. Also, I work in brand marketing. I won't say that, so maybe I have a little like, I think it's more about, like, Mass awareness, or like, brand marketing, um, push. Um, she would be awareness effort more so than a sales kind of system.
19:08
People's Point, yeah, and I think the key key words that was mentioned is Association right. When we hear Republicans show this? Um. What associations come to mind? This is it's, it's sort of. It's a very clear set of associations that they're trying to to reinforce or create right, and, and this ad targeting everybody.
19:33
Um, not just REI. Current REI consumers. And. It's interesting, but it's definitely, you know, my goal is talk about branding, and I'm going to take The Branding aspect of this. We can. We can argue if you want if they're selling particular products. I don't think they are. Um, but there may be showcasing kind of what kind of products with not being emphasized, right.
20:00
I think the emphasizing this ad is on the people and what they're doing. And it's, it's done in a kind of in an unique way. Yeah, exactly. Go ahead. Can I convert, uh, say something? Yeah, of course. I almost feel like it's outdated. I don't know how old that commercial was, but uh, one.
20:21
It wasn't very diverse. I think I saw one African-American in there, and I think our country's economic conditions have completely changed. And, uh. The people with disposal income and free time, I think, are getting smaller and smaller. A lot of people working future. Jobs they can't afford that mountain bike.
20:37
And if there was a smart REI, would uh would transition their, um? Advertising. Accordingly, they might. You know, show that even in financially constrained, uh, times that people can still participate outside. Uh, possibly. Yeah, I think I, I. This isn't a new ad, but it is very diverse. I think there was way more than one African-American, and then there's there's.
21:03
They did a pretty good job trying to to cover their bases. They're also not doing not everything they're doing is actually expensive or require specific products, so this ad is available online. You know, you can go through it, but in general, at least they were trying to be very inclusive, um.
21:22
And if anything, going on a hike is one of the least expensive things you can do. Uh, as entertainment. And so, you know, I think that the general message is still is still appropriate. Um, furnace, yeah, and we also have besides like purchasing things. They also have a rental market as well for these pretty ineffect, like cost efficient things like hiking or biking.
21:51
They have bikes for rent, um, or other equipment. So, yeah, I. I did think the ad hit a wide variety of people who have funds and who don't have as much funds for these activities.
22:09
Oh, go ahead. I'll step out. No, you could go ahead. Well, well, I don't know. I didn't, uh, I don't know if they, you know, that was really emphasized the rental aspect of it. I love REI personally, but, uh. I, as somebody who maybe never went outside much, uh, the average person might not understand how REI works as a co-op with rental options and stuff like that.
22:30
I, for me, a destruction I was almost blinded by all the images and the music was over. To me, Overkill, it was really, uh, it was like going to Las Vegas and just, you know, being overwhelmed by all the lights and noise, uh, so that's just my opinion. So I tend to agree with you, but that's I think the point is, they're not actually trying to describe a particular service or products.
22:51
I think they're. I think this ad is kind of, like, oh sorry, no. Go ahead. Oh no, I think this design is kind of more like of selling a Vibe of like REI is, like, really, uh, people caring, uh, so? Um, the associates themselves, outdoor people, and also associate themselves where they care about, like people, like, not only just like they also treat their employees like, really well, like, have this day off for them to like, really go outside to experience the Wilderness and also like, because they're sharing so much of like this.
23:22
This different activities they show themselves as like a store that you can come here and then buy everything you will ever need for like outdoors activities, I think. That's more of like a Vibe and also like a. Like, a value after like reflecting their value more than a particular or specific product.
23:43
Yeah, so. This isn't the classroom we're going. We're analyzing advertising per se, so in every added, no ad is perfect, and stuff like that. I'm not going to compensate, I'm just. I would just want to show you example of an ad that fits into our discussion later. You'll see.
23:58
This isn't the typical adword where we've featured some products and stuff like that. It's definitely different. I've done better or worse, we can. We can talk about that, um, as much as we want. Let me move to another example that you might, uh, all know, um. Does everybody recognize this brand?
24:25
Yeah, so this most people recognize. Do people know the story of this brand?
24:35
Yeah, I think it was, uh, bought. I think it was, was it, uh, like a joke, is bought by like a sports star or something like that? No, no, not a joke. So, um. I'll do it very quickly. Just just I'll start with. This is now. The second largest sporting good brand in the world.
24:56
Okay, so it's second to Nike it's. It's past Adidas a couple years ago, which is, which is pretty remarkable if you have an industry that's that's, you know, that's dominated by Giants? To enter any industry like this and succeed. Um.
25:19
Yeah, so, uh? This was started by a football coach. In Baltimore. Who couldn't find good enough? Cheap enough clothing for the team to wear under the all the protective gear. Knowing that there are new high-tech Fabrics. He basically sat down and and put together and stitched. Under clothing. For the football team.
25:49
They loved it. This was. Um, all the all that high-tech could provide, and they started talking to their friends. And very soon, he began getting requests from other teams. And that's how he started. He sold these undergarments. For sports from his van. Uh, in Baltimore. Right and, and from that.
26:13
They grew a brand that that is now, like, unbelievably large and and successful. Um. Yeah, and someone says under underarm is under underrated. Well, this is sort of an underdog story. So when they started, they ran ads like this. So, I'm going to again switch. Sorry, I have to do this.
26:38
Um. They used to run ads that looked like this.
26:53
Dear Canada. Thank you for your application to our Valley Academy. Unfortunately, you have not been accepted. Professor, I'm not sure you're sharing the screen. Sorry. No, am I not? We're only hearing audio. Oh, really hold on. Thank you for letting me know. That is embarrassing. It was a good visuals, but let's try again.
27:24
Let me know if you can see this.
27:30
Yeah, yeah, okay, let's go.
27:39
Dear candidate. Thank you for your application to our Ballet Academy. Unfortunately, you have not been accepted. Relax and your feet. Turn out. Achilles tendons. And leg and torso length. You simply have the wrong body for ballet. With your body, you could be a professional dancer in Vegas. And at 13.
28:16
You are already far too old. To be considered.
28:53
Even those who have the body and the training still most will never make it.
29:11
Okay. Do people recognize her? Mesquite Copeland, amazing principal dancer. Incredible! Um. Prima ballerina. Of the USA. Um. But clearly kind of an underdog Story, right? That's what the ad is actually showing us. And. There is an Under Armor brand on kind of the back of her neck. On the bra, but you can barely see it.
29:52
Right, but it's just you see the brand at the end and says I will. Yeah. Um. So, it's another Underdog Story. Instead of just do it, they use terms that. Athletes are used to hearing in the locker room from coaches. Right, they talk to athletes, and they basically. If you think about their mission statement.
30:22
They try to make athletes better. Right. It's not a brand that says we are for everybody. It's like, no, we will. We will Empower athletes to reach their goal. We'll talk about that in a second. Um. Again, this is a world dominated by other big players.
30:49
Yeah, definitely segmentation, um? Many times Brands will have a core segment they target. For example, there's a brand DC Shoes that was started by two Surfers in San Diego. That's a skateboarding brand. They target the athletes. Those that compete in extreme games on skateboard. And everybody who wants to be like them.
31:17
Also wants to wear the same brand. And then there are people, so they're skateboarders like these issues, and then they're people who like to think they might sometimes skate. It's like an onion type of segmentation, and then they're just people who think that if you're young and active, it's cool.
31:32
So I'll try to wear the same brand. These are the non-skateboarders that still by these issues. Um.
31:44
Brand archetypes. We'll talk about that in a second. Yeah, so, but but you know? As as the brand grows, they have to evolve, right? And they want to reinforce the same values, but they're not the same brand exactly right. Under Armor is not exactly an underdog anymore, so they go and do something.
32:04
I'll switch again, and I'll show you a more recent ad. That I think. Really powerful.
32:18
Let me know if you can see this before I start playing the ad this time.
32:28
You see a black screen? Okay, here goes. Shouldn't be black anymore.
32:47
Is the last good? I swear. I have no regrets for the past is behind. Tomorrow, reminds me just.
33:13
Quite see the end. How can I realize?
33:33
Know, you say, don't? The last goodbye.
34:01
What do we think about this one?
34:37
Not quite an underdog, right? There is some Underdog Story there. There's some battles, but what do we see in this ad? Do we see, like, like the people? Do we see him winning? There's a hint at the end, right? We hear the audience.
34:58
It emphasizes more of like the journey that it took to get to the awards. Because that's like what we see. We see the athletes like when they win and like we see them like. Plate like we see them at the awards ceremony. But then, behind all of that, there was this whole journey.
35:16
And within that, there was like, like, like, specifically. With the ad, it shows like the early mornings. It shows, like all of the training and like, even like the moment where, like he gets frustrated that, you know, maybe he did it. Get the best time that he wanted, that he was training for, and so, like, you see, like the whole picture of what it took for him to, to get to his success.
35:40
Right, and if you think about the brand values, let's go. I'll take your screen back.
35:49
We make all athletes better. Through passion design, he's doing what she always does. Right, this is, we see hard work. We see frustration we see pain. If you think about athletes. The sentence at the end it. What it's what you do in the dark that gets you into the light?
36:10
That's what the coach says in the locker room. Right? So, this is like, everybody knows, you know, more. Way more people know Phelps than I see Copeland, um. The, you know, the reality that we live in, but? By the way, if you ask Phillips, who's the best swimmer in the world, you know what he says?
36:37
He says, Katie Ledecky. Which is kind of interesting. Uh, shark is not fair. So, uh? Under Armor is definitely positioning themselves with this ad or series of ads in a particular way. Right again. We're not seeing a particular product. We barely see the Under Armor brand, although it's there all the stuff they wear is under armor, so you implicitly get kind of a set of products.
37:07
But what it communicates is? We're with you athletes. Right, we are there in your journey. That's our job. We are committed to. Your success! Yeah, so again, okay, let me move to kind of more formally. What is a brand? We hear we hear this term a lot. We use this term a lot.
37:32
Let's define what we mean by brand. When you hear about, what do you think a brand is?
37:44
Story.
37:50
Your business. Present value. By trust, reputation, and promise. Recognizable. Associate with the theory. Who are you? Okay. Nice use of ball, um? I'll show you a textbook. There are many definitions. I'll show you a textbook definition that I think is ballpark right and and kind of captures a bunch of what you said, but not everything.
38:25
And there's really two important things about the definition. So, the definition is a brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, or design, and you could add sound or whatever it is. Or a combination of them intended to identify the goods or services of one or a group of Sellers and to differentiate them from competitors.
38:49
Remember, the perceptual maps were looked at and distance is differentiation. A brand does two things. If it works, it helps identify and helps differentiate. Okay, so all the stuff you said is maybe right if it is used to identify and differentiate? If you look at the brand and you say, what is this well?
39:12
And someone says, it's just like the other brand. The brand is not working. Okay. So? That's kind of what the brand. It's supposed to do. We'll talk about. What it is in a second. I'll show some examples. Does anybody recognize this brand? Right. These are four letters in the English alphabet that actually make no word that existed before.
39:42
Right, and they're written in a particular colors in a particular font. Yet, we recognize this and we kind of know what we can find in this, and we know it. We might not be able to find we know when we want to use it or when we don't want to use it, right?
39:54
So, this brand is working, right? We identify any differentiates, right? We know how it's different from Amazon, for example. Um. Here's a, what is this?
40:13
Nike. Okay, people said. Nike people said, swoosh. It's a check mark. I kid you not. It's a check mark, but this particular check mark if you even know the name of it, right? Swoosh. Why didn't everybody in Zona knows it's Nike? So this is basically this is the power of branding, right?
40:30
I use this symbol and suddenly we know all this stuff. And we'll talk in a second about how this works, but this is extremely powerful. Think about how powerful this is. I can use this particular check mark and so much is communicated. Another kind of one that we recognize.
40:49
This is the leaf strong wristband. This is how a non-profit organization to raise money for cancer survivors raised 40 million dollars in two months by selling one cent rubber Banner for a dollar. Okay, so that was a really cool branding. State's Postal Service is a brand. Why does the government agency need a brand?
41:17
To differentiate themselves from the private companies and do the same thing, exactly right. The moment you have competition? A brand is a powerful thing, and they invest in their brand, right? They sponsor tour de France teams, right? They do stuff to work. Here's a word that does exist in the English alphabet, but this particular brand means something different.
41:42
Right, you know? And you know what to expect on this brand? You might know who the founder is. Lots of information is conveyed. Can't talk about branding without probably? Until a few years ago, at least for sure, the most well-known brand in the world. Okay, um? The brand. Exists in the mind of the customers.
42:02
Is, if any company thinks the brand exists in their documents, they are wrong, right. The brand only exists in the minds of the customers, and as such, it's a perceptual entity depends on facts. Okay, we'll see exactly how we model how it's, uh. Kind of structured, but it's all about creating mental structures, right?
42:26
If I show you Ikea what comes to mind?
42:34
Furniture. Furniture. Big Warehouse, build it yourself. Swedish.
42:48
Ah, we got frozen yogurts. I usually get meatballs. Oh, here's meatballs. Right? So clearly, that's, that's a successful branding exercise, right? Look how much information we get. Trader Joe's is very good at letting you kind of know what you can find there, but also what you can't find in Trader Joe's, and they do it on purpose, right?
43:08
Part of Trader Joe's differentiation is that you can go there and buy. I don't know Clorox cleaner. It's just. It's just not something that finding creator shows. Branding also helps consumers organize information Microsoft Office. Is actually a collection of Brands. It's Microsoft Word, which is a brand Microsoft PowerPoint, which is a brand Microsoft Excel, which is a brand right and a bunch of other things.
43:33
But Microsoft Office is a nice brand, because if you have a if you have an office or a home office, then you might need software that's called Microsoft Office, right? You check mark all them at once. Um. Amazon.com, right. Amazon also existed before, right? It's either a big river in South America, or, you know, an ancient tribe or female warriors, right?
43:54
None of which is what this company does. They managed to infuse meaning into amazon.com. That's, uh, yeah, basic. Basically, that's this is like the everything store. Right, um, and differences. Could also be actually in appeal, not necessarily in in the actual product. So, of course, as a beer, how is course different than than Budweiser?
44:29
Someone asked, how is it a good idea for Traders not to have one of the routine products? The answer is, if they force you to go to a normal store. You see the difference you feel the difference? Right, if you just had to go to Trader Joe's, you'd grow accustomed to.
44:43
This is how stores work, and you wouldn't appreciate a bunch of stuff they do.
44:51
Yeah, so cores these advertisers Frost brood. It's different. But really, if you strip the labels from beers, there's a there's a scientific article about this. Is strip the label from beers. Most beers are indistinguishable. There's seven attributes, characterized beers, the body for fermentation, bitterness, whatever people can distinguish most peers.
45:12
Guinness is different. But most normal beers are essentially the same, so value is in the appeal, and they try to. Yeah, Rocky Mountain Water. Whatever that means, um, people can tell the difference if they don't know which beer it is, especially if it's cold. And. It's the same that only about the third of the people can distinguish Coke from Pepsi.
45:39
Right, and most more people say, you know, about three quarters of the people think they can distinguish if you actually do a blind test about a third can distinguish quote from Pepsi. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly so, uh, so value could could be an appeal. One interesting thing is that they took up in Caltech.
45:57
They did a study in an MRI. They had a pipe that people could drink a liquid, and they monitored activation of different areas in the brain. And there was a screen in front of people, so Coke drinkers when they saw the brand Coca-Cola. The pleasure Center started before the dream was piked.
46:16
Pepsi dreamers who sold the brand Coca-Cola didn't exhibit this phenomenon. Right? So the brain in anticipation for pleasure already started working just by seeing the brand itself. Brands are powerful, right? There's definitely a real effect that that happened. Um, okay. The common model for Branding in general and for The Branding activity is called the brand resonance model.
46:42
Whatever. It has four levels. The basic level is salience, basically. Awareness, never heard of this brand. If someone says yes, then you check mark awareness. Second level is basically knowledge. Like, do I know what, what to expect from from Coca-Cola, right? Third level is judgment kind of. What do I think about this?
47:08
Do I like Coca-Cola? Do I not like Coca-Cola and and so forth? And the fourth kind of Hallmark of branding is relationship? Like, what is this? Doing for my life. What is my relationship and it's a really nice article where people are were interviewed about their coffee habits and some people describe coffee as nostalgic.
47:31
Some brands are nostalgic for their parents house. Some Brands make them feel good. Sometimes, they cheat on their main coffee with a different brand right. They talk about coffee in relationship terms. One company that's very good at this is Apple. Die Hard Apple fans, not even customers. Will pay more and wait longer for a device that sometimes is not as advanced because it comes from Apple.
48:00
Right that this is, this is powerful, right? It's it's if you can get people to have a strong relationship and people. Some people have relationships with shoes with watch brands with electronics, but also some people when they work in a lab. They view some device as their partner for Success.
48:17
You come with a different device. They're not. You're not happy to switch. They trust this brand. Somebody mentioned trust before trust is a huge thing. And I think we mentioned it before. If you think about Advil versus ibuprofen. Many people use Advil because they trust it more. Is the CVS ibuprofen as as effective?
48:37
Is the efficacy the same, I don't know? Yeah, lots of, you know, lots of lots of interesting stories about branding and relationships, but many brands don't attain relationships. Um, and so that's kind of the Hallmark, but it's a pyramid, because if you don't, if you haven't heard of a brand, you don't have knowledge if you don't have knowledge.
48:57
You can have a judgment right, and if you don't have it knowledge and a positive judgment. You can't have a relationship unless it's a hate relationship, so it could be a negative judgment. Um, anyway. So, this is the kind of brand resonance pyramid and brand elements are all those components that are used to kind of reinforce the brand.
49:15
When you set a name term, sign whatever, so I'm going to go over it pretty quickly. These are the trademarkable devices that serve to identify and differentiate the brand. Uh, yes, they do have some hidden relationships as well. Um, some people have a hate relationship with Apple, but still buy it.
49:36
Right? So, so that's? That's. That's another version. Um, now I am not a lawyer, right? So if you actually want to want to do, um. Do work related to branding, I suggest, and you want to make sure that things can be trademarked. You should talk to lawyers. Okay, so this, this class is not substitute to talking to lawyers.
49:59
Um, but in general, if you sound principles. It's really helpful if, because you're going to identify and differentiate if your brand elements are memorable. Okay, what makes some something memorable? Two things really one is fluency. It's easy to process. And the other is repetition. So, Nike tight Crest, for example, are our names that are short.
50:28
They're fluent, they're easy to repeat, um. They were, you know, the word Xerox is not as fluent. Right. It might be memorable from other reasons, but, but it helps with your brand. Elements are memorable. Um, it helps if your brand is Meaningful. For example, if you first see a brand called Lean Cuisine, you kind of know what to expect.
50:53
Right. The brand MasterCard communicates that this is a really good credit card. The word Visa, by the way, is memorable was supposed to communicate something else, but it kind of never stuck. So nobody knows why Visa is called Visa. Um. It really, really helps if your brand elements are likable.
51:15
You can. You can grow people's liking towards a a brand element, but if it's already likable. That then much of the work is done, and you could do research and show that people respond positively to the term Firebird people respond positively to the term Hot Wheels people again from the target market.
51:34
Um, that's required. It also is super important, especially in this day and age. Your brand element is transferable. Torreg is the uh, was the VW? Suv. Why do they pick the term the name Torig? Do you know?
51:58
Torex. Oh, it's a bowl. It's a tribe, isn't it? A Wandering tribe? Yeah, North Africa, exactly. So, it's, it's a nomadic tribe in the Sahara Desert. And what a better name. If you want people to imagine that they could go with their SUV. And, and, and kind of traveling, the Sahara Desert.
52:21
The problem was that after they launched it. Um, some more attentive people noticed that the Torex are notorious to be slave drivers. And that exploded in their face, and that that was pretty sad. If you want another example, the Mitsubishi SUV was called Pajero. Which in South America has a pretty pretty negative meaning.
52:48
Right. So, what you want is you want? Uh, brand elements that can.
53:01
That's, uh, that can be transferred to to, you know, across languages across cultures across. And also across time. Because. In the 20th century, what was 20th Century Fox? Right. It was the current studio, right? It's the studio for now. Comes 2001, and you're, like, oh, you know, it's last century Studio.
53:28
That's not the same. So, another 21st century folks. Right, and now you have to come up with all new kind of, uh, reinforcement and associations or whatever. So, think about these things in advance can save you trouble. It. Also, that's where the lawyers come in. It also is important that your brand is protectable.
53:46
Some parts of speech are not protectable. Right and, and there's a famous story that Google. Actually, they intended. It says Google, I don't know the story, but but it's a spelling mistake they intended to to write Google than the really large number. Because it's a search, and it could reach really large number of things.
54:06
But they misspelled it because they're both. I don't know, um, not native English speakers or whatever. For whatever reason, they spell it and then became easily protectable. But if you want to call your brand tomorrow, you can. But other people can use the term tomorrow, and you can do anything about it, right?
54:24
So, and that's where the lawyers come in. You have to check, um, drug companies when they think about the name for a new drug. Part of the reason drug names are so weird is because they search very long and very hard for something that doesn't exist anywhere in any language in any term and stuff like that because they want to create something new that is distinguishable and whatever.
54:43
Um, okay. So, this is this is for band elements. I think the key the heart of branding is again. This is a model is how we think. Brands are stored in the brain because they said brand exist in the consumer's Minds. Okay, so our? Version of this is that there is a network of associations.
55:08
That that consists of a brand. So, if I say the word Volvo? And note that that has the word Volvo gets activated, and because it gets activated, it has. Associative connections to a bunch of other nodes who also get activated. So, in the case of Volvo, when I say Volvo, what comes to mind?
55:36
Safety, Swedish, reliable, safe car.
55:46
Sunroof. By and large Swedish. Safe, reliable. In a car, of course. Are the most common associations for Volvo. Another association, oh, the cover of my childhood, another association's family. So, manka, so? Volvo for the last 25 years has been trying to also make sure that when you hear the term Volvo, you also get activation for performance.
56:22
Is because they actually have good performance. And so they run ads where you see kind of someone in a driving in a snowstorm and someone next to the driver says. How are you driving in the storm? And then they say, I'm following him, so you zoom out. And they're following a snow plow, so you zoom into the snow blow and someone next to the driver of the snowplow says.
56:45
How are you driving in this scorm, and he's, and he says, I'm following him, and you zoom out. And there's a Volvo goes all-wheel, drive in the snow, and it's all kind of warm and cozy in the car. And there's a family there, and Volvo says, see performance. And what does the audience see?
57:00
Oh, safety, family car, maybe boxy because of the particular design, right? They don't see because these associations already exist, right? They did too good a job of creating a network of associations, you know. And these associations, of course, in a spreading activation way. Weaker activation for further out, and this network that's activated.
57:22
This is really the brand. When someone says? The brand is in the mind of the customer. This is what we need to think about a network of spreading activations. If I say Harley-Davidson, what comes to mind?
57:46
Biker again, Cruiser motorcycle leather jackets. Bikes, Hells, Angels, cool bikes, motorcycle, reef sleeves, long roads, community motorcycles. Extensive Sons of Anarchy black colors, right? See how consistent these are? So, in fact, you know, one of the most known brands in the world is Coca-Cola. The brand with the most consistent brand is probably Harley-Davidson.
58:19
Because many people have not heard about it, especially if you stop people in random street in Europe, they've heard of Harley-Davidson. Some might say no. The people who did hear how? Who do know of Harley-Davidson? They have the same story more or less. And that's kind of a work of art.
58:36
Harley-Davidson doesn't care about everybody knowing about Harley-Davidson. They care about if you know about Harley-Davidson. This is what comes to mind, right? Even though most people riding Harley-Davidson today, a white collar weekend writers? Who want to partake in the experience. You guys just described. They want to have this, so the Harley-Davidson Associations that come most often worldwide are Rebel.
59:02
Macho. An American. Okay, those are the three most common. And, of course, this is in the context of biker gangs, Hells, Angels, Sons of Anarchy, long roads and stuff like that. So, Harley-Davidson, instead of running some ads, they'll invest in like events, big events that have a lot of people riding across the country, like the Posse ride, right.
59:24
They'll do things like that, because that reinforces the brand. REI will do things like, opt outside instead of running an ad on TV for some jacket. Because that reinforces the brand right. This brand associations that are here. Once you create them, they're hard to change. But if you create the right ones?
59:47
Then you are identified and differentiated, and that's really powerful. Okay, that's what branding is about, because then if these associations describe my positioning? Then, I don't have to work very hard. Right, because the customers know exactly what to expect and how am I different?
01:00:13
Yeah, um, okay, so this is, you know, more formally. It would look like this. There's a brand, their immediate Association, the subsequitization, more distance associations, and by the way, it's very easy to do this market research to find out, just like we did. Now, you go to someone and say, when you hear of UC San Diego, what comes to mind?
01:00:31
Right, and they could say University of California. They could say biology, they could say. Hospital. Right, then you say in the context of UC San Diego hospital? What comes to mind, and they'll continue to say, and then you can trace? Yeah, you can trace all the different associations, and then you can ask yourself.
01:00:49
Is this what I had in mind? Right. Is there a gap between where I am, which is, which is what you get in something like this, and where I want to be?
01:01:11
Yeah, so everything I say about Brands? Is true for anything. It's true for University, but it's true for you as a person, your brand, your name, and it's definitely true for a sports team. And.
01:01:29
The the brand of sports team. There's a question here is super interesting because of course people like winning, but there are there are brands that haven't won in a long time and have die hard following. Right, because because it's all about what are the associations? What are the values if the values is, you know, the value could be never give up?
01:01:50
Right, people like to support Underdog teams. Yeah, there's lots of examples. Yeah anyway, so every again everything I'm saying here is, is, is very general that you can brand anything and and, and you should brand everything that might change competition because this is a powerful tool, but you need to have your positioning to know what associations you want to have here that are worth for you.
01:02:16
That will that? Will that, will I help you differentiate? From everyone else. Okay, so I'm just going to give you one example of using kind of Association Maps. This is an exercise we did with Electronic Arts coming up in the Bay Area. You might have heard about it. Um, it's video games.
01:02:35
In this particular case, we worked on a game called, uh, Battlefield, which is a, which is one of the big first person shooters. Cod's Call of Duty that's by Activision Blizzard and CO2 COD. Call of Duty is the two-ton gorilla, right? They have the largest market share Battlefield is number two.
01:02:56
And electronic Arts was trying to understand how they can. Improved, strengthen work on their brand to help them win more of their of the customers to their side. And so this is kind of what these games look like. Um and. We did this market research in New York, La, Berlin, and London.
01:03:20
With various segments of Gamers and non-gamers. And. This is an example of one person. The brand is Battlefield. What comes to mind? This person says. Fun friends, first person shooter, violence gang. To say in the in the context of Battlefield fun? What comes to mind achievement? And then later.
01:03:48
If you find out self-esteem friends? Bodies pressure you say pressure? Why pressure girlfriend? Oh, okay. Um, in the context of Battlefield first person shooting what comes to mind Call of Duty, huh? Here's your competitor. Right, so you can map out what's going on? You can do it across many customers and or potential customers, and then get a picture of what's consistent.
01:04:14
What's not consistent? You can. Designate. Some of these are positive. Some of these are negative. Some of these are solo sound. These are social really depends on how you want to work with this, but this then kind of you can. Screens become data and you can summarize these in tables like this and say, kind of.
01:04:33
Here's where brand is empirically right now, with these kind of customers, and then you can ask yourself, well, what should I do about it? You can also look at how this varies by segment by your casual Gamers. Your regular Gamers and your hardcore Gamers, right? You can see there's fewer negatives in your heart for your hardcore Gamers.
01:04:58
For in terms of Battlefield, there's two million players that are considered the hardcore Gamers. They pretty much develop the game for them, which is why, with regular and Casual Gamers that are that are at least 10 times larger, they don't do as well because they're not focusing on them.
01:05:13
So, this is an attempt to do this. Um.
01:05:22
Yeah, there's that too. Um, you can basically classify these these associations in many different ways. You can connect it to customer lifetime value. You could look at Network analyzes. You could also look at the resonance model kind of how much people are aware. What's the level of knowledge, attitudes, relationship.
01:05:41
You could look at the breadth of Association, the depth you could do like an emotional cognitive ratio to see whether your brand relies more on emotions or on kind of cognitive thinking how uniform these associations are again. Consistency, like Harley-Davidson, you can work with this. But this is like, if someone says they're managing a brand, and they don't know these associations, they don't know what they're doing.
01:06:05
Right, they think they know what they're doing, but they don't know what they're doing. And this is very powerful. Okay. So? What I'm going to say now is going to be pretty obvious. Given this mental structure, right? So, these are corollaries that come up from these models. Some major questions that people ask themselves.
01:06:27
The first is to Brand or not to Brand.
01:06:36
Yeah, yes, exactly. So, brand associations are impacted by lots of things, right? They're also, of course, they're employed in influenced by performance in the product itself. But you can position the same product in different ways. Remember candles, you can position them as something that makes light or something that makes Ambience or something that is romantic, so these associations will determine what positioning you actually have.
01:07:02
The question to brand or not to brand is chronic is kind of simple. You say, oh, we have a startup. We'll worry about the brand later. No, don't. Because associations you create from the start? Are going to stick if you don't pay attention and don't make sure that the associations that are created are the right ones for you.
01:07:19
You will have an uphill battle establishing your positioning and anytime you you will or might face competition. A brand is important, right? Intel. Had a brand for a long time, but only when they face competition. They put a sticker on your computer that said Intel Inside. Right because they were facing pressure from AMD, the big competitor that came into the market.
01:07:43
So? Branding is important. Um. There's always a question of brand extensions, also called umbrella branding. For example, most cars that Ford makes. Are forward with a couple of exceptions. General Motors is a house of Brands they own many different brands. Each brand is slightly different positioning. Right? Um. Who makes Lexus?
01:08:15
Toyota okay, Toyota is a brand. It's a good brand. Why not call this car Toyota? Lexus is a luxury version. Ah, okay. The answer in, you know, now we can be more formal. The brand Toyota carries associations that are not as consistent or helpful for a luxury brand. Now, Lexus is not a secret that's made by Toyota, so Toyota is going to be somewhere in the association tree.
01:08:44
And it's going to get the benefit of maintains market value from Toyota reliability from Toyota, but it's also different, right? So, if you want to create something different? You often kind of have a different brand and not put it under the same brand. Do you know the car's smart small car for two people?
01:09:05
You might have seen it around. Who makes smart?
01:09:14
Okay, Mercedes is the right answer. It's half the answer, who's the other half? It's Mercedes and?
01:09:25
Ben's is the same brand ever since. Smart is a collaboration between Mercedes and Swatch. The Swedish watch brand. Yeah, Coca-Cola is mostly a hassle brand. Um. Why not call a car? You're it's kind of obvious why. Why you don't want to call your car's watch, even though Swiss isn't reliable and affordable, not bad?
01:09:57
But why not brand your car Mercedes? It's a good brand.
01:10:15
Okay, so Mercedes is expensive. It's a different Market. It carries different associations, right? They're not bad associations, but it carries different associations. So, they're trying to do something new by coming up with a new brand. Also, exactly, water is down the luxury. So, if the association of smarts are not consistent with Mercedes.
01:10:36
You could weaken the associations for Mercedes. Also, if the car ends up being a failure, you're going to hurt. The brand Mercedes, right? So, there's risk involved in brand extensions? So, but it's all it's all about these associations, right? Um. Do people know the brand DeWalt? Black and yellow power tools.
01:11:03
Who makes the Vault? Is it Milwaukee tool? But Milwaukee is part of the story, not Home Depot.
01:11:21
Is the Craftsman and get them guess Black and Decker? I don't know. Black and Decker? It actually is Black and Decker, Black, and Decker makes the vault. The reason Black and Decker made the world is because in the in, there's there's three segments, right? There's there's industry, there's home user, and there's a Tradesmen.
01:11:39
The Tradesman is the largest, most important segment, and in the Tradesmen segment, Black and Decker was losing to Makita, the teal blue manufacturer from Japan. Not because the tools were not good, but because Black and Decker started making kitchen appliances. And when you're a Tradesman, your tools are your identity and who want to be called dead on a work site.
01:12:03
With tools that that make kitchen appliances. Right when they stripped the labels? Tradesmen rated the Black & Decker tools really highly. So they own this old brand the world for. For big saws for factories and they made a huge operation called operation, sudden impact, and they used the fact that Black and Decker has service centers everywhere.
01:12:28
And they promised treatment, 24-hour service, no downtime. You'll get loaner tools. It's black and yellow for the work site and basically in one year covered, reclaimed like 65 of the market share by introducing the walt. Okay, clearly a branding, branding trick. But it works to this day, right? So, unlike Toyota, most people don't know.
01:12:51
It doesn't hurt too much if they know, but but it's different. Um. Okay, so. It's also complicated when you have a merger and acquisition, right? That, um, when life when life Technologies it's now Thermo Fisher acquired some company in the East Coast that manufactured the basic manufactured supplies for labs like salt or sodium, or something like that that company they acquired had such Bronx.
01:13:22
Such strong brand, following it, could command a price point for salt. For sodium. If you're going to change their their name now to the new to call them Life Technologies, you're going to throw all that work for years into the into the trash. So, how do you handle the fact when you buy more Brands?
01:13:41
Is is kind of an interesting thing again. It's all follows from the associations. You know, you can think about. It's not, no, nothing. Magical here. Lots of examples. I think we talked about a bunch of things like this. Um. Upscale. You can think about Lexus. Uh, brand extensions. We talked about line extensions, co-branding.
01:14:04
Okay, here's an interesting one. What is caterpillar?
01:14:15
Instruction vehicles. Right, a large, heavy. Kind of rugged construction equipment. So, how do they go from that? To this.
01:14:33
Clothing, foodwork, toys, scale models, gifts and accessories, work gear.
01:14:42
Strong brand Association. Right, and the question is, which brand associations, right? So, instead. So, they said, okay, we have this strong. So, we're we're equipping the work, you know, kind of the the, um? The workplace environment for construction. So, we're going to do rugged shoes. Right, that's consistent, and we're going to do rugged.
01:15:05
Kind of tool. Keats and stuff like that, and before you know it. Equipping the workplace becomes? Extendable to products if they maintain the key values that they're reliable and rugged and whatever. Yeah, kids toys of the models, but the models, you know, the kids toys were also different because they were metal or they are metal.
01:15:26
They're rugged. They're like, they're not your plastic, uh, toys. You know, my favorite is, is, like, I don't know what was like that. There was like a mouse pad that was caterpillar with, but you know, again. Uh, and, and you can see built for it, right? So, it's, it's all about the construction.
01:15:43
Oh, here it is the keyboard wrist rest. By braces. If you want to identify with a brand, you get people to buy stuff like that. Another nice examples is Swiss Army. Swiss army knife, the one on the left. You probably recognize one of the most recognizable branding brands in the world, the the gis in World War.
01:16:04
Came back. With these Swiss army knives made by the way by by a by a shop in Switzerland called Victorinox. And they were known to be useful and reliable. And, uh, and kind of functional. So later, they said, you know, we have this great brand awareness and knowledge, right?
01:16:28
We are, we're functional, we're reliable. Um. High quality and Swiss. Like, what can we do? And I was, like, oh same, characteristics describe watches. So, in the 90s, they launched Swiss Army watch. And in the 90s, that was the biggest. Imported. Biggest marketer of imported Swiss watches to the US with Swiss Army watches.
01:16:55
And then they said, oh, really, you know, functional? A reliable, high quality. You know that, you know, that's more generally, even that's equipped for life's Adventures, right? So then, they started doing travel gear. And the one thing they made sure is that each travel gear had an extra functionality that wasn't existing in other travel gear before.
01:17:18
And then they had. They had a kind of a blunder because there were some complaints about the quality of the travel gear. You can't have that. If you're a Swiss Army, so they took up and redesigned the whole travel gear, making sure that nobody you know that it is quality, right?
01:17:32
Because these are the brand values, and if you want to grow, that's how you grow. You keep reinforcing the same Val same values. These days, there there are some Swiss Army shops. For example, there's one in Soho in New York. And I kid you not. They sell a surfboard.
01:17:50
Right. It's not something you think about in San Diego. I went by surfboard. I'll buy Swiss Army surfboard. But the idea is that they're equipping you for life's Adventures. There are also many mistakes done by companies. So, one of my favorites is the Harley-Davidson. Birthday cake! Which, and if I'm not, I'm not sure how it reinforces the values, maybe?
01:18:17
Another one is the Zippo perfume for men. Which again? Um, as someone who studies branding this, this makes no sense, and the chicken soup for the dog lover, Soul senior dog formula. Right and, and the last thing I want if I produce food? Is the association dog food to be created for my food?
01:18:44
I don't know if you remember, but Taco Bell used to have this Chihuahua dog. In their ads. And they stopped because people started associating Taco Bell with dog food. Right, if if I show an image and repeat it a lot, that Association is going to be created, right? These associations are real, and you can do.
01:19:03
You can do them well or. Yeah, or or or or fail. So here, these are some fails. You could I bet you if you Google you'd find a lot of them. Um, I think this is. This is all stuff we talked about. Trans associations will be transferred, um. You want the good ones to be transferred.
01:19:21
You don't want negative associations. Whatever we talked about, this is pretty obvious. There's lots of examples of brands that kind of evolved from original products trying to kind of maintain the same associations and reinforce them. Hopefully growing from pancake mixes to more General breakfast food, and you can see how that follows if you do it right.
01:19:43
Um. Lots of mistakes like Gap warehouse, for example, that sold kind of discounted Gap stuff ended up being not differentiated from Gap. So whenever they open a gap Warehouse, sales of Gap kind of dropped to nearly zero. People don't buy gap for the latest fashion, right, so that that's a fail.
01:20:02
Lots of kind of examples. Here, you'll have the slides, um. Failure can hurt the original brand or whatever. So, these are some empirical findings on branding so. You want to extend your brand when there's positive associations when there's a match, right? Again, pretty easy. Um, here are top brands of the survey that people would like to see some extensions of right Apple's doing pretty well.
01:20:27
Nike Starbucks, Ikea Guinness 12, BMW Avita. Um. Example for? The bases can can vary for for the extensions, but sometimes you can rely on more abstract attributes to grow so. That's that, um. Yes, okay, things can fail. Yeah, it's pretty obvious we don't need to waste time on this, um.
01:21:00
Vertical brand extension so? Gap is an example of a failed. Kind of upscale. Alexa set an example of a good one we talked about. Here's an interesting example, so Marriott has a. Interesting vertical product line vertical is usually the dimension we talk about quality. So, Fairfield Inn. Doesn't say Marriott, but it says Marriott in a small font.
01:21:30
Courtyard by Marriott already has the name Marriott. And you know, it's not a full-blown Marriott, but it's pretty good. Marriott Resorts in hotels is like the flagship, and then Ritz Carlton doesn't even mention Marriott. Right again. Think about associations now. It makes sense, right? If you want to go if you want to, if you're willing to pay for the Ritz Carlton, you don't want to think about this is a Marriott.
01:21:55
This is the Ritz Carlton. Right, so? Product lines. Vertical product lines often will play with kind of the the prominence of the parent brand. Now, measuring Brands. Basically follows, and oh, by the way, we always want to measure Brands, right? Because we, every tool we use, we want to know if we're doing it well or not.
01:22:21
Um, so it's just going to follow the resonance pyramid, right? The basic measurement is awareness or reach. And it's the simple answer to have you heard? This brand right? Have you heard of REI, yes or no? Um. Do you know? What area? What do you know about them? Do you know what they do?
01:22:46
Do you know what products or Services they carry? Do you think of bread are the brands you can think of that have awareness but no knowledge? Like, you've heard the name, but but you have no idea what they do.
01:23:07
There was a weird case. Interesting case. I think it's weird, um. In the early 2000s, I don't know if you remember, but there were ads on TV, many of them. That's basically showed the duck that walked around, said Ah, Flack. Aflac. That's all it did, like the ad didn't tell you at all what this company was about, and it was so pronounced that, yeah, other examples.
01:23:37
It was so pronounced that Ben Affleck came on TV and said, please stop. Please stop everybody's going to tell me Aflac. And this is because the CEO came to Linda Kaplan Taylor, who owned branding agency in New York. And basically told her here's 350 million dollars. I want every household of America to know the name Aflac.
01:23:56
He's, like, do you care? Did they know what you do? No, I just wanted to know the name. That's why I think it's weird because they could have done much more. It turns out it's a secondary employee insurance company. Whatever, so can. It can easily happen that you heard of a brand, but you don't know what they do.
01:24:16
Um, and then there's attitude, right? This is the Judgment part. How do you feel how much do you like? How satisfied are you if you're a client, um, notice that attitude is not a preference, right? I could like two Brands, but prefer one of them. If I have a choice, right?
01:24:32
So, so not the same thing. Um. We all end up using some brands that we don't like when I ask classes to name brands that they don't like. Um, other than the DMV. We also get a lot of the Telecom providers and stuff like that they're notorious for. Not, not getting people to like them as much.
01:24:53
Um. Yeah, so precisely so serving utilities and service and and cellular are are the lead. DMV is always kind of a one there so, but this is important, right? Because we can't have. Generate kind of relationship and get loyalty from customers. If they don't like us, if they don't have a positive attitude.
01:25:15
Front frontier. I just feel Frontier and you can get ice for free, but if you want a cup of water that that it costs you money. Um. Relationship. This is the highest level. It's also kind of interesting to measure. What is this thing to you? And this is often we would have more elaborate type of market research.
01:25:34
You have people describe the brand and kind of extract narratives and stuff like that. Here's where qualitative research is kind of helpful. Dmv is a brand. Yeah. Um, for, for better or worse, you identify it and differentiate it. Okay, um? As an exercise. If you want to yourself, you can pick a brand.
01:25:55
I just put Aria here if you pick any brand and think about what your associations are and see kind of what your brand is. I'll summarize them can have some questions. The brand exists to help identify and differentiate. It's a tool that you can use if you manage it well.
01:26:12
It actually exists in the minds of customers. As associations and networks of associations with spreading activation. Consistency, where the rest of the strategy is key you want brand. You want the associations to be. What's the positioning implies? Right? If you don't get your positioning, then you don't have the positioning you want, right?
01:26:35
So, it's very important. It's a powerful tool as we saw, but you have to manage it. Well, Brands that do well usually are brands that invest a lot of money kind of in in. In doing this again, it doesn't seem to be advertising. It could be what REI is doing, like they're taking a strong hit on sales to reinforce the brand, hopefully to recoup the sales in the rest of the year.
01:26:56
Um. That's kind of summary about Brands. I wanted to because you, you're gonna decide. I want to give you a couple more things just before we finish. Just an example. If you are tasked with with the with a weird task of saying, here's, you know, Cartier is a luxury jewelry maker.
01:27:18
They also make perfumes French company. If they told you we were? We're going to make luxury spring water. How do you even start?
01:27:34
So, you start by thinking about, well, okay, what would be the value proposition? What are our capabilities? What are the customer needs for something like this, and what is competition? And, and you'll realize that you know there could be something here. There could be value proposition. High-End hotels, first class, whatever it could be that that high-end.
01:28:00
Drinking water is a good substitute to champagne. If you're health conscious and you don't want to drink alcohol, but you don't want to appear cheap. Right, you want to impress a date, but but you don't want. Drink alcohol so, uh? You would think about what is the positioning kind of?
01:28:19
Who's the target audience? Is it b2c? Is it B2B? What is it that you're? You can give that others can't, and then think about kind of your your proof points, right? You'd apply the positioning, which, as I said you last. As I told you last time, if someone comes to you with a business idea, this is what you have to do.
01:28:36
Think about okay, given everything that you told me, what would be the best positioning? Now, does it make sense? Do I think there's there's an opportunity here for a business? Um and and see how that works from that. All of these things will follow right. If you think about spring water from Cartier, what's the price range you charge?
01:29:01
Like how much you would you charge for luxury spring water?
01:29:11
What is a lot?
01:29:15
One of the things. If you follow on this, you can find you'll find out that in order to do appropriate market research for price, I need to have a feasible range. 99.50 a bottle fifty, plus over a hundred. If you Google the most expensive water, you'll see that. There's crazy Waters out there.
01:29:35
I think there's like a small bottle that's like harvested from rainwater in Tanzania that never touched the floor that you could buy for, like 500 a bottle, right? There's some weird stuff out there. Definitely, uh, depends on how you position this right. Are you positioning this to compete with champagne?
01:29:52
Are you positioning this as something else again? All of these things CRM is customer relationship management. Sorry. Uh, acronym, we haven't seen before. All these things will follow from your positioning, so that's why positioning comes first. I wanted to give you some example of a real-life marketing plan. This is, uh, well, sorry.
01:30:14
This is kind of. We talked about all this, so this is just summary.
01:30:22
And this is the thing he's talked about. Sorry, I don't know what happened. Let me just do it again. I'll share.
01:30:42
This is what I wanted to show you. Um. A marketing plan. This is taken from a commercial. So, there's some weird things. We have some executive summary situation, analysis, Market needs, and Trends. SWOT, which is strength, weakens opportunity and threats. All of these are going to be things that you derive from the value proposition analysis we talked about.
01:31:05
They have critical issues in environmental factors. It's also regulated environment in Banks and then their marketing strategies, Mission Direction and objectives, product strategy, pricing, strategy, promotion, stretch. This is all going to follow from the positioning. And then they have market research financials and forecast performance controls and whatnot. This is what it might look like in a particular case might be different from other companies, but I just wanted to show you that everything we talked about is what goes into these documents in real life.
01:31:35
Okay, I am going to end here. I'm happy to answer any questions that you guys might have. A question Professor, um, you know, in, in the two sessions that we've had. I mean, we've talked about the values, the positioning statement, and I'm just getting the idea that positioning statement is probably the most important thing that any company can do.
01:31:59
And yet, we probably all have been taught that. You know, it's the mission of the company, and that hasn't been brought up. And so? Um, what? What is the relationship between the mission of the company and the position statement and the whole branding component? Yeah, that's a, that's a, that's a fantastic question.
01:32:21
So, the mission of a company often doesn't change, right? You can write it on. You can print it on the wall and not have to have painters work very hard after that. A positioning statement. If you ever, if you have a complex company, there'll be a positioning statement for the company that's derived from the mission statement, but is strategic, it differentiates, says how you differentiate it.
01:32:46
Right. Mission statements are hardly ever differentiated, and they also don't explain why. And the reason you want this explains here. And why is, because, as I said, things can change because we have the best technology tomorrow. Some company from outside the US comes with a new technology that's better than yours.
01:33:04
What do you do, right, your? You have to adapt your positioning. The mission could be the same. But the positioning should change more than that. Positioning in a complex company is often a matrix. I have the top position for the company, but then I have positioning for Brands I have.
01:33:21
I might have different brands, and I'm positioning for products. If they're sufficiently important to have a positioning. So, in this business school, for example, we have a mission statement, right? We want to educate ethical leaders. For the world and whatever? But we have different positionings. We have positionings for prospective students.
01:33:43
We have positionings for perspective company from kind of industry Partners. We have positioning for donors. Whether positioning for faculty when we're recruiting new faculty, right? All of these are consistent with the positioning for the business school. Yet, they're specific to their target market, and the key is they cannot be inconsistent.
01:34:06
Because if there's inconsistency, you fail. Customers are confused. They don't believe you, you lose trust. But if the position is at least consistent, they don't contradict. Then you can actually have a bunch of positioning statements to work with. And a position statement is a working document depending on how fast your industry moves and your category moves.
01:34:28
You need to update it and re-evaluate whether it's still true. I'll give you even more extreme example. When we start a company when we launch many of the things in our positioning statement are assumptions. Like, we hope to be able to deliver this technology. We hope to be the first to Market here.
01:34:47
We hope to be this as we we advance in our company. We replace these assumptions and hopes with facts. Right, it's you know we don't have? Double the the third output of, or, you know of the competitor, but you know we have one and a half? That's good enough so, so that's good, right?
01:35:08
We hope to have double book, we don't. So, we adjust our positioning. We hope to be the only one doing this. We're not the only one doing this, but we're differentiated in this important way. So, positioning statements are leaving documents that help you guide the strategy, and I completely agree with you if you know.
01:35:24
When I teach a marketing course that's, that's 30 hours. I tell everybody that if the one thing they remember 10 years when I was positioning. Then they got their's money's worth. Because the rest just makes sense. Once you have the positioning and in order to do together position, you've done the value proposition analysis.
01:35:40
And you know exactly why you have the right to create value, which is why your company exists. Why a product line exists, or why the product exists? Hope this makes sense. Thank you.
01:35:56

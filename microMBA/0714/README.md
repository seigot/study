02:36
We'll give it like another minute. Can you give me a thumbs up if you can hear me? Big thumbs up, all right. Thanks, Steve.
02:51
I would if you guys are open to it, the more of you that can put your camera on the better. Obviously, that makes me feel like I'm talking to people instead of a screen, but obviously. Your best choice. Professor Floyd up. This is Marva Abdallah. I am one of the coordinators for the micro MBA.
03:11
Would you mind if I shared a slide with just a couple quick reminders on it as people are streaming in all right. Fantastic. Thank you so much.
03:35
Folks, this time is really valuable, and so I don't want to take anything from Professor Floyd's time. But these reminders did go out in an announcement today on canvas, but just to recap, there is some confusion about the great recording in progress that will be. Made available ASAP were just checking a couple things with the micro MBA team about what needs to be visible there for all students.
03:59
And then reflection responses are available on canvas. You have a link there to answer a question in relation to the lectures. Those are graded on completion, so please try to get those in about within the first 48 hours after each lecture. This Wednesday, we will be having an optional micro MBA online networking reception, the zoom link for that reception, is the same as our class link.
04:26
And also, if you have not signed up for a coffee chat, we need that you email us directly so that we can give you directions on how to ensure you are signed up for the two required chats. Thanks everyone. There's no class this one with that. So, Wednesday's class is being replaced.
04:42
I mean, it's been on the schedule since the beginning of the summer session. But yeah, there is an optional networking reception on July 16th. There's another in-person reception later in August, and so those are both on our schedule. But yes, if you know you choose not to attend, that will not count against you.
04:59
But I highly recommend you attend. It's really a fantastic networking opportunity that we like to provide for students.
05:11
My turn.
05:16
Are you good? Okay, there's a thumbs up. All right. So people can see the slides. Yes, so good, all right, perfect. Yeah, Bureau permanent. You can let me know as we go. Uh, all right, so welcome everybody. Um, all 202. Of you that are joining. I think I'm your.
05:43
Third class. Now, if I, I think it is leadership and power, and maybe AI? Um. So? We're going to be talking about accounting for startups today. I've done this for the micro MBA, probably like four or five years. I've lost track, probably four, or five years in a row at this point.
06:04
We'll get into a second. What that even means accounting for startups, but probably a little bit behind the motivation for today, is it's normally good practice to have some sort of accounting, uh, along the way. If you were full time MBA student, you'd be required to take an accounting class.
06:21
That being said, accounting is not everybody's favorite topic, right? So, I think, packaging it into accounting for startups makes it maybe. Uh, more useful, a little bit more practical, maybe even a little bit more digestible in a two-hour format. Um. I will say this. Um, it's probably something that a lot of your professors are going to talk about.
06:43
I think you guys just had a lecture about AI. Um, AI is certainly a big piece of business landscape right now. Is changing a lot of the way things run? I'm not really going to integrate too much in the way of. Ai. Today, it's going to be mostly like a first principles, sort of like thinking about problems type of class, um.
07:06
But certainly, I just want to caveat. Before I start that, everything that I show you today is probably some developer AI stuff going on in the real world as well, right? Uh, the way that I run. This is mine's two hours. The reason that mine is two hours is because, um, accounting for most people, not everybody is fresh new topic.
07:29
So there's going to be a lot of things that people probably haven't seen, which means every. 15 minutes. I'm going to take a break. I'm going to stop and just take questions. Um. With that in mind, it's uh, there was no pre-assignment or anything like that. I'm going to explain it in a second.
07:47
This is definitely I kick your feet up, you know? Grab coffee. Uh, sort of, go along with the ride type of two-hour class as opposed to. Um, necessarily you having to bring out a pen and paper do things along the way, right? So sort of interject me. When you guys want to talk about something more depth?
08:06
Before I do that, let me tell you who I am. So? I was introduced with Professor Floyd, but Eric was totally fine. Um, I have been here for. Maybe 12 years now. I'm a 10-year professor in the accounting department before. Here I was at Rice University for several years, and then before that, I got my PhD.
08:31
With the University of Chicago. Boom, School of Business. Um, I was the first accounting Professor here, actually. So, Rady's about 25 years old for the first portion of rainey's existence? Accounting was sort of taught by adjuncts or visiting professors. When I came about 12 years ago was when the department started since then, we tend to have about four or five faculty.
08:55
Hopefully, we're growing, and um, I was actually in charge of building our professional accountancy program. So, if any of you are interested would be an impact degree here, which is massive professional accountancy, so I get to interact with anywhere from people that are just trying to get an idea of the basics of accounting all the way to when it becomes epas and professionals for for Major firms.
09:19
Um, this is specifically about startups, you know? Um, there's a lot of different ways to think about accounting, most of which we're not going to talk about today. But I do have experience working with startups expensively as well. So, my research interest that's that abbreviation ESI? Has a lot to do with working with startups, which we call an entrepreneurship success initiative.
09:43
All about how we can make startups and help startups do better. Get better access to funding things like that, so I work a lot with start our blue. Start our rainy here. I've done experiments across the country in many different incubators and accelerators worked in Japan, corporate accelerator programs and a lot of that experience has to do with helping them under skill.
10:08
Onion cheese so we can talk a little bit about what happens in real life as we go. Um, I just want to mention that pretty much. Every Professor probably has a slightly different expectation for how they run their class. I know your assignment. Your grades are mostly Reflections, and you guys are obviously feel free to reflect on this class as you see today.
10:28
Um. But I just want to emphasize this class is probably a little bit different. It's a little bit more unique to to me. In the sense that we have two hours to cover something that's a 10-week class. Right. So by no means is anything about what we're about to talk about for two hours, supposed to be something that you master by the enemy.
10:50
That is not even remotely the goal. It's not too all right, really. What I want you guys to take away from this as micro MBA students that are around campus in different capacities is to just get a taste for what's out there, right? What the type of things that we talk about, what some of the concepts are, what some of the issues are so that your Reflections can be more about, you know, if you ever become interested in accounting or startups or starting your own business.
11:22
You sort of. By the end of today, sort of start to realize what you don't know, you don't know. Which that makes sense. You'll learn. To know what you didn't previously know that you didn't know. I know, that sounds confusing, but it's more of an exposure type related class, right?
11:37
So, I say, at the end, that this is one of the densest. I don't know if that's true. Some of your Finance classes at the end are very dense as well. But since I'm at the beginning where I'm really at that third class, sometimes it can feel a little bit dense.
11:54
So, let me sort of. Start out with the motivation, um, just based off the topic or the the name of the class, the name of the class is accounting for startups. But really, what does that even mean? What is accounting for startups, right? Now, in my world, there's a lot of different.
12:13
Not a lot, but there are many different types of account, right? There's tax accounting, managerial accounting. There's cash accounting, there's accrual accounting. There's a whole world of accounting that if you get your ad back or your MBA. You'll come to learn, appreciate, understand, and see how it applies to the business world.
12:35
What you've all seen before is Cash account. So, you guys have all seen accounting or one way or not, right? Cash accounting is the type of accounting that accountants talk about. When you think about, like your own personal balance, right? So, every day, when you wake up, not every day, but regularly, you look at your bank account.
12:54
You'll look at your debit account, you know. Maybe you'll look at your significant others for kids, whatever, and you sort of track your assets. In terms of what cash you have available. Right. So, what's your cash inflows? What's your cash outflows? That's a type of accounting. A very simplistic type of accounting, but nevertheless a type of account.
13:19
It's going to turn out that major corporations that you're familiar with, whether it's Apple Tesla. Right, Microsoft. They don't use cash account. Right. So, if you look at their publicly disclosed information about those companies? It's not just what in my bank accounts look like it's not. How much cash did I bring in and how much cash should I spend?
13:43
Instead, they use something called accrual accountant. Okay, now it's kind of like a fun joke. You know, it's a cruel world of counting, you know, we make when we're in the classroom. But accrual accounting is what you would take if you came to me for 10 weeks in the fall, and you were MBA students, right?
14:00
It takes a while to learn. It's a long process kind of a painful process, but if you've ever heard of debits and credits and all that good fun stuff. That's a cruel account. And really, the purpose behind accrual accounting is that? Cash accounting just doesn't summarize the firm very well.
14:21
Certain number of reasons, some of which is firms have other types of assets besides just cash, right? So, if we had an accounting system that just tracked our cash well? What type of fixed assets do these firms have, right? Is it possible that they can have expenses that aren't cash related?
14:41
What does that mean? Well, it can get complicated, but there are instances in which firms will take on economic expenses, even if they haven't actually paid cash yet. Right. These are called payable accounts. If you, if you guys are familiar with that, do your everyday work experience. So, there's a big difference.
14:58
I'll get into it later, but the main point that I kind of want to get after for now is if this class or this 2 hours is about accounting for startups. Is it kind of a way to get you guys sort of wet your appetite for accounting? Accounting is mostly used by.
15:17
Individuals. Accrual accounting is mostly used by corporations. Which begs the obvious question. Where does the startup fit in all of that, right? Startups aren't really individuals, but they're not really yet. Corporations, so, what is this class even about, I guess, is really the point? So, you know, it's kind of like a fun joke that I've used a couple times in this class.
15:39
You can go to Amazon, and this may have changed, you know? But if you type in accounting for startups? Like, really. Nothing comes up. You know, entrepreneurial Finance? Deducting the right way, the accounting game, no accounting textbooks like you would ever see in my class. But it's kind of fun because this one book right here.
16:01
If you click on it, it says they bought this book. Now, they're a millionaire, but only if you also purchased power positive syncing, right? So if you buy, if you buy one of these books, our positive thinking, then they're obviously some benefit according to this person. But my main point is to say, uh, you know, there's not a lot going on.
16:20
So, a lot of what I'm going to teach to you. Today is sort of how I think about accounting for startups, and hopefully you guys will find it interesting. So before I move on, does anybody have? Clarifying questions for what we're going to do for the next hour and a half hour and 45.
16:40
Anything about my background? Feel free to raise your hand. I can call on you. Also, as we go forward. If you have questions, please just raise your hand in the video because I tend not to look at the chat because too many things going on at the same time.
16:58
Okay. So, let's sort of. Start with the basics, uh. Is that a thumbs up? Okay, good thumbs up. All right, oh wait, Helen, good. Yeah, could you say again? What's the ESI stand for? Oh, I can tell you really quick. So ESI is an entrepreneurship success initiative, so we ran a.
17:21
What we call a field experiment, which a randomized control trial for any of you that are involved in medicine or biotech. But what we did, is we randomly provided sort of financial education? Like, I'm going to show you today to about 600 to 700 startups across the country. And then we sort of tracked them for years, and we try to see, like.
17:43
Did the financial education help them be better startups? Did it help them get financing things like that? The outcome of the experiment was pretty interesting. Um. This is gonna sound weird on the surface, but What happened was the education? The financial education actually caused startups to quit their startup earlier.
18:08
Right, and so one interesting feature of, uh, learning Finance for your startups, and many of you here of the 240. Might actually go start your own companies, right? A lot of people think that what I'm going to teach you for the next two hours is really about, like, how can I really understand my revenues and my costs so that I can get some Venture capital or an angel investor to invest in my company.
18:33
A lot of times, the value is actually that you can learn for yourself whether or not it's a good path for you to spend the next couple years of your life, right, like, or what would I actually need to do to reach the profit that I would need to do to justify doing this?
18:50
So we found out is doing this type of framework. Doing the accounting actually helped. People understand whether or not it was a good use of their time. In a lot of cases, the answer is probably not right. Make sense. Perfect! All right, so. Uh. A couple points here. I have a lot of practical experience, I guess, based off that, too.
19:19
I've worked with a thousand startups at this point in some capacity, right? So, you know, you seen it all at this point. I'm going to show you over the next hour and a half that even if accounting isn't always the most fun thing to do, it's extremely necessary and important your individual lives for your startups.
19:37
If you're in a corporation something? But it can be difficult to do, and it's tedious. So what that means is almost all businesses start out with cash account, so even though I told you just a slide a go, that cash accounting is probably most useful in a lot of ways for individuals, if you will.
19:55
It loses its appeal as firms and organizations grow. Still, when most sperms start out, they just default to cash accountability. Why do they do that well? The sort of practical answer that you'll hear a lot is. Startups will say cash is King. Right, you don't have cash then. You can't build a product, right?
20:18
The problem is, is that eventually down the road? Right, more sophisticated accounting, whether that be what we talk about today. Rule accounting if you take my MBA class. It does become necessary, so there kind of becomes this point in time in which you kind of gotta bite the bullet and learn it, right?
20:37
The question, of course, is why or when. So for me, you know, to have the opportunity to meet 240 students around campus or not, students, but my current MBA students that are in different roles? You can get exposed to the benefits of it or right. Now, the reason that technically it's also true is because the biggest.
20:59
Asset that startups have is something called intellectual property, and it turns out intellectual property and accrual accounting is very difficult to deal with, but we're not going to really talk about that so much today. It's a technical point if you guys want to talk about later. So, what we're going to try to do?
21:16
Is, we're gonna try to motivate where to start at the county comes into this. But, like, I want to make a really quick point. I'm going to call this an advertisement if you will, right? So sort of a reason that if any of the next hour and a half interests you for startup accounting that taking MBA accounting, or you can also take account into the extension program.
21:36
Why accounting is interesting and why you want to get to know? Your friendly accounts to give you an idea of where accounting is different, right? So why you might want to get your MBA or take an accounting class? So, let's imagine, and this is again a separate topic. I just want to help you guys understand how big the world.
22:00
So, let's imagine that. As a firm, you pay $1,000 for raw materials with cash. Okay. Let's imagine we're making shoes, and we have to pay a thousand dollars for the Rev range. If you were using cash accounting? Sort of that basic version of accounting that most startups start with that.
22:21
You, as an individual, would start with. This sort of income statement if you will would be really simple, right? That transaction would be reported as $1,000 expense. The reason it would be reported is a thousand dollar expense is it's negative thousand dollars in cash in your bank account. Okay, simple, easy to think about.
22:44
In accrual accounting, it actually doesn't work that way, right? So in accrual accounting, which is the accounting method that corporations that are publicly listed in the United States are required to do and disclose to investors you would actually not record the expense at the time that you made the $1,000 purchase money.
23:07
Before I sort of like, tell people why does anybody want to take a guess? Why? That's true, or why that might make sense. Anyone? Take a guess because you're holding the inventory of the material you Bob. Yeah, but at a simple level. That's one reason, right? So the idea here is when we think about an expense, right?
23:30
We think about it as a reduction in the value of the firm. It's a reduction it's like we call it shareholders Equity, but the equity and the firm has gone down. Because you took an expense. The issue here is that, yes, you paid a thousand dollars. For a raw material, lost a thousand in cash.
23:51
But you've gone another asset, right? So, you, your thousand dollars less in cash, but you got a thousand dollars worth of raw materials, right? So did the value of the firm really go down. No, you really just traded one asset for the next. Right. So, in an accrual accounting, what we do is we basically make.
24:10
Some adjustment. For that, we record a transaction that looks all scary, but basically what we do, is we debit inventory for a thousand credit cash? Right. The moral of the story is you don't recognize the expense when the cash was met. Okay, exactly because of what I think Don was.
24:29
The unit just said, because it isn't an expense because we just basically turned it into a different asset. Okay, now we're not gonna get into it too much. When would? Well, we would wait, and we would recognize the expense when we sell the people. Because when we produce the inventory and the inventory actually weaves, the firm is gone.
24:51
Somebody purchased it. That is an expense because we lose. Another example that you might see in your arms. You work for UCSD, we do it the same way actually. Imagine you sell good? Whatever. Now we sell the shoes. Can we sell it for $2,000, but we sell it on account?
25:15
So, what does on account mean? Well, it means that when I sell shoes, sometimes buyers will pay me in cash right now. Sometimes they won't. You the rate of contract that says, I'll pay you in three or four months. If you're using cash accounting there again, there would be no entry.
25:38
You wouldn't do anything. There'd be no Revenue, cuz you didn't get any cash, right? I don't know not to pick on you. Do you think there would be any Revenue effect in accrual accounting? Since you got glass on, right? Yeah, I assumed you have to have an accrual of Revenue because it's come in.
25:59
No, you haven't had the money come in and you've lost the inventory, so you'd actually lose value. Yeah, he closed, so you're right at first. So, actually, what would come in his Revenue? Yeah. Asset. Right, the value of the firm, the equity increase, the acid is not cash. Instead, it's a contract that accounts receivable, then hopefully has.
26:30
So, again, you can see where we're going here. It's not as simple as cash. Now, the firm deals with assets and liabilities that are non-catchments. Right, he would actually say that now, whatever. This is all complicated. It's 10 weeks that you would take this class. What I just want to illustrate you guys in the micro MBA is the world of accounting is a lot bigger than just?
26:52
In close and out close of cash, right? If you were in my class, we'd spend a couple of weeks all right, like there is an extension course as well. If you, you guys are interested? The point, though. I do want you guys to know if any of you guys actually come up with a startup is you can start with cash accounting, but if your startup grows enough, you will eventually have to use accrual account at someday.
27:20
If you IPO, which is very rare, but let's imagine you IPOs, which means that you have did an initial public offering simple way of saying you go public. Now, you have stock on the NYSE. You're legally required to use approved calendar. Even if you don't. Banks will still ask you.
27:42
Accrual accounting financial statements. So, like a really interesting story, if you're familiar with it, it's been in the news a couple times that the current Administration the SBA is a small business administration. They were also in charge of like issuing some of the PPP stuff back with covid. It used to where they do small business loans, where they give loans that are backed by the government, and they work with banks to give loans to startups small business, right?
28:11
They actually for a period of time required. Not really required, but they asked. Startups to submit financial statement that we're actually accrual accounting in nature that looked a little bit more like the second bullet point than the first bullet point, you know, you need to take that class to understand.
28:31
Which is really interesting because a lot of my friends that own gyms, our own restaurants, were coming to me, asking me, how do I do this crazy or cruel accounting stuff so that I can get a loan from governments back right now? Luckily, unfortunately, the government realized that that was unnecessarily High bar for these small businesses to have to do.
28:53
But it is a statement that these type of accounting things become relevant. Even if you're not sophisticated corporations, right? So something to keep in mind, something to look for? You already know trash counting, so I can't do that also. Hopefully, what you figured out in the last couple minutes is, I don't have time to teach you a parole accountant.
29:19
There's a 10-week class. It's actually more like multiple 10 week classes to learn the ins and outs of how all this. Before I go. Yeah, Abby, sorry if I said that wrong. Hi, uh, I had a question, so you mentioned that, uh, accrual accounting really comes in when you're about six years down the line, and it's like a big, big enough Corporation.
29:39
So, if the small business Association is asking for something like a career accounting. Does that change the sort of the playing field a little bit? Yeah, this is a good question, right? So, there's a lot of Dynamics that kind of moved around. That statement is based up. We took some research, you know.
29:55
In Sweden, you can actually get data on startups all the way back to when they're like six months old, right? Because they're much more transparent in their data clients from there, and what we found is sort of empirically. You kind of see that acrylic tablet starts to matter in that it produces fundamentally different insights.
30:15
Into, like six years old. That's, of course, a different question from. If the SBA is requiring these type of financial statements and levels might appeal, and in fact, you're right, right? And it's, it's true. Um, I can't tell you exactly what year that matters for startup. It kind of depends on the trajectory of that startup.
30:35
If you're, you know, if you're starting a lemonade stand on the side of the street, you might literally never get to the point. Whereas you can be a hydro startup and you're looking for some sort of. Um, investment. Pretty fast, and you might find it relevant quicker. But yes.
30:53
Banks can ask for these type of things. Investors can look for it. You might even find a situation in which. Venture Capital type firms look for it, not because they necessarily care that you do it because it's a signal that the investor. Is already. Startup founder is capable of doing so.
31:13
I've been in small Banks before, like Regional local banks. Small business owner produced financial statements that were relatively sophisticated, maybe not. Full of cruel accounting but had elements. How patrol accounting in it and the bank manager actually took it as a positive signal that the small business owner was sophisticated enough to be able to do it, right?
31:40
It was like a signal in and of itself. That makes sense, right? So there's a lot of Dynamics that they're going. Accounting can be relevant institutional constraints, showing that your business Acumen. Eventually, you know, regulatory. Uh, requirements, right? So, there's a lot of reasons to note. I will say one last Point here.
32:01
The reason that I bring it up a lot, and I emphasize it to this group of 242, even if you never get into. This is because you never know what become can become very painful. Is you have a really good idea for whatever reason you're in. Whoever Department you're at or whatever firm you're at, and you start talking to your friend and you guys have an idea and you're working and tinkering on the idea.
32:25
And then, three years down the road. All of a sudden, you do go to that bank, and they say, where's your rule accounting, and you have to sit there and be, like, oh my gosh, what do I do? I have to go back. Take all my notes. Try to figure out what to do.
32:39
So sometimes it's good to at least know what this is about before you start. That makes sense. Can I answer your question? Could be mean, you know, I'm an accountant, so I would have made it seem as cool as possible, but? They certainly a practicality time. Uh, any other?
32:56
Commons. Uh, yeah, clip one. What does a slash r stand for on your slide? Oh, sorry, anytime. Something like that comes up so that accounts receivable. So, when I sell to Avid, even sorry if I pronounce it wrong, feel free exactly. And he doesn't pay me originally. He does like an IOU, so to speak.
33:19
Like, I'll pay you in three months. That's called an accounting. Lingo accounts received that receivable means I will receive money in the future. Does that make sense? Got it. Thanks. The the flip side of that is called an accounts payable. A payable account would be if attic was my supplier, and he gave me supplies, and I told him that I would pay him in the future.
33:44
That would be a payable, cuz it means that I still owe him.
33:55
And then on that same one. You probably already said it, and I missed it, but the CR period Revenue. Oh yeah, so this is all the stuff that I was. I'm telling you exists, but I'm not gonna worry you for the next two hours. When we record these in an accrual accounting class, we use a debit credit system.
34:15
So we do debits and credits. Have any heard of this, the debits and credits of the world. So, Dr stands for debit. CR stands for credit. It's a system. It's a system in how we record transactions, right. I put that there for you guys, just so you can see it, and it looks cool and whatever that.
34:31
I think, Elizabeth, you asked that is to go in the details and how all that works that would be taking it out in class, right? Thank you. I just wanted you to know that it kind of exists in the background. Yeah. I think for a micro MBA sort of.
34:47
Hopefully get you guys excited about accounting and finances. David Davidson credits for an hour and a half wouldn't be the most exciting thing. So, what kind of a what kind of save that if you guys decide to come, see me? So, what bin am I going to do for an hour and a half?
35:03
You already know. Cash accounting, like, I just said cruel accounting requires more of an investment of your time. So, let's kind of like. Meet somewhere in the middle, uh, let's build a financial model. Okay, so let's think about how we can think about the basics of accounting related Concepts.
35:23
And s. Features of accounting to build some really basic financial statements for a startup. Okay, and now we're I think it's going to differ a little bit for startups than it would be for a corporation. Is most corporations financial statements are retroactive. In other words, what Apple presents their financial statements and their financial results?
35:46
They're describing what happened in the past? Okay. Startups tend to be a little bit more forward looking. Right? If you're a one-year startup, what are you going to describe nothing essentially right? So, when startups tend to think about presenting financial information? Through their accounting knowledge, they tend to think about a little bit more forward-looking.
36:08
So, my definition of accounting for startups today is gonna incorporate a lot of the features of accounting, but we're just going to try to project it. Think down around and there'll be features of accounting that play into that, but, uh, hopefully we try to have a little bit of fun and think about how much relevant guys.
36:32
Now, what does that look like? Well, it's a detailed quantitative model of one's business. So, basically, it's a cohesive plan that articulates and models time. Effort money is required to bring a product to Market. So, instead of, you know? If you want to think about what accounting goes here, instead of just sort of talking and ideally formatting ideas about what your product is going to look like.
36:56
We're going to try to put it. On paper, one more specifically today for the purpose of illustration in Excel file, right? Something that gives us the numbers and helps us think more. Concretely about how we're going to go about this process. So, in a nutshell, we're going to translate the sort of more qualitative elements of the business model and the underlying assumptions into a quantitative piece.
37:21
And I'm gonna call that accounting for the safety. Right, because accounting is all about economics turned into information. There are typically two ways that people do this in practice. Bottom up versus top down. I'm going to show you both of them. And how they differ. But most entrepreneurs use what we're going to call a Bottoms of financial model, which means they started a very granular level and worked their way up to the big picture as opposed to starting in the big picture and sort of.
37:53
Occasionally detailing. More granular information. The reason has a lot to do with. What was? Just asked. An entrepreneur and a startup to Billy, ability to communicate the information that we're going to talk about for the next hour and a half says a lot or signals a lot to potential investors and creditors.
38:16
About their business Acumen and their understanding cases. Okay, so it's useful for many reasons, not just. The numbers. Any assumptions? Any questions there before I move on?
38:39
Okay, so a couple other points before we get into it. Building a detailed bottom-up model forces you to figure out all the Gory details of how you're going to build prices. So here's what's really interesting about accounting financial modeling is, you have to think about your Enterprise in a way that you typically touch, right?
38:57
So, if you're say you're in the process of building shoes, like we talked better? You're gonna think a lot about the claw, a rubber, how to put it together, you're going to think a lot about. From an engineering perspective, how to build the bench? When you build a financial model, right?
39:15
If it really makes you think harder about the specific business details of how that business is going to develop and take the product to Market? Right. So, in other words, I have sat down with many startup Founders over my career that can tell you everything you need to know about how to build a product.
39:37
But don't really think very hard about what the market size is, who the target market is, what the profit would look like, what the cost would look like whether or not you can build the product at a reasonable cost that actually develops a profit, right? You have to think about all of these things when you actually build a financial model.
39:59
To the point that was asked. Gave you 25 minutes ago about the ESI? Oftentimes. Oftentimes, when Founders do that for small business owners do that, they realize that their business maybe wasn't as profitable as they had hoped. It makes them pivot, which is, think about it differently. Or sometimes they do.
40:22
We sometimes they realize that it's a nice idea. It was a good dream, but it's not practical. Now for the serial entrepreneur, maybe not a big deal for somebody. That's thinking about leaving their day job to pursue entrepreneurship man doing this and really making sure that it's a good idea.
40:40
Not true. Okay. So, you're basically going to try to validate your business model, right? Also provides a basis for understanding the important assumptions for your business websites. I sort of think about it instead of three different phases. When I develop Financial models, right, the first is anytime you think about.
41:05
Starting a financial model, we always start with the business model. Doesn't make any sense to do accounting Financial models or anything of the light. If you don't think about the economics first. Right? Any accounting number is just a reflection of the underlying economics, so understanding the business first is most important.
41:26
So before you ever start any sort of financial modeling or accounting exercise, ask yourself, what is the business? What is the revenue model? How do you plan to bring your product to the market? What is the market? How do you acquire customers? Where does the money flow all these fun stuff?
41:44
Right, which should be pretty complicated when you actually dig into the means. Then we dig into something called unit economics, but you if you have taken an economics class, we don't necessarily use those words. But when we talk about entrepreneurship, we do. We mean by what is the relevant unit?
42:02
I mean, how does the startup scale? Right. So if it's a gym, the relevant unit? Is the thing in which revenues and costs scales by? That tends to be a member, a member at a gym. If you're developing surgical supplies, the unit is probably a doctor because the doctors use the surgeons.
42:27
Right, you're developing golf clubs. It's the golfer, right? So, what is the relevant unit that your business scales? And then you start thinking about a lot of the stuff that we talked about in other classes. It's the variable cost things like that. Yes, hi, um, I was wondering if you could give an example, or maybe if you're going to give an example of like, what bottoms Up versus top down?
42:52
Looks like I will. Okay, so I'll tell you right now. This is like a heads up when people do Financial models. The bottoms up where the top down would be something, like, hey, you know, the? The market size for golf shoes is? I don't know 100 million dollars, and I think that over the next.
43:15
Three years. I can capture 3% of that market. Therefore, my anticipated revenues are three, right? The Bottoms up would be to start at the basics and say, I'm developing this product. This is my clientele. I think my shoe is going to be most appealing to 30 to 35 year old males in San Diego.
43:36
What is that size, then? What is the price they would buy out, and then is there seasonality in the market? Is there different tiers of product a lot of assumptions that take you from pricing quantity build up to rent?
43:53
I'm that kind of sounds more like a valuation to me of the company, rather than like accounting. Well, I mean accounting is a key piece of valuation, right? Okay. So, when we evaluations the overall value of the company through their financial statements, well, that's Financial projections, right? So, there's a this accounting-based valuation is a thing, right?
44:14
So, when people value companies a lot of times, they do it from. Accounted students so you can think about this class. If you want to, you could think about this more as thinking about how to project financial statements with some end goal of potential valuation, and certainly that would be true, right?
44:30
If you're a startup, you're producing financial statements. Some purpose of that is probably for investors to think about valuation, right? That's true. I've taught financial statement analysis many times, like, what do we do? We go through financial statements of corporations and think about valuation. Yeah, evaluation is the discounted sum of cash flows or earnings, which is accountable.
44:57
All right, so they're fundamentally released. Any sense? Yeah, thank you. Good question, though. Excellent question. And then the third piece. What is the scaling look like? So, startups are all about scaling. So, what is the lifetime value of customer? How do economics change over time. One thing I want to emphasize that's interesting about startups is their trajectory looks much different than major mature companies, right?
45:29
Apple big companies that they're hopefully at that point a bit more stable. Worse, things can change startups. You're in the you're in the curve, right? So a lot of them die. A lot of them have big growth curves. So, how do you scale? Right. How do you expand all of those things are assumptions that really matter in the space?
45:48
So those are the things you'll think about in a mod. So, how do we create this financial model? Well, it looks a little bit like this. So, first thing we do is we start with an operating plan, which I'll show you. So, there's an overview of the activities that must be performed to develop the technology and all the Milestones they support, then the Staffing plan, which is the Personnel need to execute said operating plan.
46:16
And then. From there, we build financial statements and financial projections. The market model. If you will is revenue projections, it really doesn't matter. What you're looking at. Whether you're looking at corporations, whether you're looking at startups. Like revenues. Archie piece of any financial statement. Like, what is your Top Line Top Line is what we call remnants?
46:40
What is that Top Line number? When you do accrual accounting, a lot of time is focused on accounting standards for coming up with proper Revenue revenue. Kind of the big piece. Then, from there. Cost projections, right? How do we think about different salaries? Facilities costs. Things like, cost of goods sold.
47:01
Then we produce financial statements, the income statement, cash flow statement. Right. We won't focus on a balance sheet as much, but And those are financial statements. That's count, right? Again, rare to your point earlier. You can see how they're related though, right? So when we think about projections of Revenue, revenue projections are, of course, if you've done Investment, Banking, or whatever it's.
47:27
It's a key feature of valuation, right? It's also the Top Line number in financial statements, so they they tend to go hand in hand, right? Line. I mean, I've always heard the term like the bottom line or saying the same thing, or is that so revenues or Top Line and the bottom line will be revenues net of like expenses that gets to buy okay.
47:50
Thank you! The top line is what I need. My revenue is. Literally because revenues are normally at the top literally. When you open an income statement, first thing is revenues. And then you get expenses at the bottom, and then the net is what got net income. By the way.
48:08
For those of you that are interested in terms net income, profit earnings, we tend to use interchangeably in the accounting world. Right? Okay. So a couple important things to remember. Revenue does not come without cost. I can't tell you how many Financial projections I've seen where startups are trying to think about their accounting going forward.
48:36
Um, almost always the biggest mistake people make is they're very optimistic about their business, their startup, or whatever. And they drastically underestimate costs. Drastically underestic sauce, right? So that's where most of it goes home. And the reason is because growth absorbs a lot more cash than people. Right, so?
49:00
Always plan for contingencies, worst case scenarios. Um, because running out of cash leads you very long. Okay, so always think about worst case scenario so that you make sure you can survive. So, let's start with the operating plan, unless somebody has a question. Any other questions?
49:21
Um, in the in the bottom of the bottom of approvich, um, when you said you'll start from, you know, pricing? Does it necessarily mean the pricing of the product. Or is it also include all of these components, including personals and? Other assets that you need to have. So, so you, you put two things together.
49:41
There, you mean pricing. In terms of what you're selling in terms of products, you're talking about different pricing strategies versus what do you mean by other assets? Um, so you also have to have facilities, you know, to run a community office space. And, you know, other computers, and you know, whatnot.
49:59
So that's what I mean, yeah, right. You put those in the cost and expense category, right? So, of course, you need to project. The revenue side, you'll think about price, times, quantity, and all the assumptions to get you P times Q. On the expense side, right? Then you need to think about all the costs that you're going to take utilities, supplies, Staffing Personnel, Capital Equipment, all that stuff, right?
50:25
Absolutely. So, I think. Yes, that has a price in a literal sense, but when we think about price on the revenue side, that's the price you're selling. To. Customers, the costs. We tend to think about the price that you have to pay your supplier, right? Both are relevant just.
50:44
Different ways. Okay. Good question. Any other questions? So, so would you, uh, include that in your like in your business in your financial model in the bottom-up approach? That, hey, you know, these are, like, my costs that. Need to be accounted for to make my product or something like that.
51:10
Well, absolutely. I mean, I think that's the part that most people Miss right. A lot of people spend a lot of time developing a product and saying, hey, this is my price. I think I can charge. This is my, it's how many people I think would buy it, and they don't think about costs and they need to be included, because unless your revenues exceed your costs, especially over the long run.
51:34
You ain't gonna make it right, and I have sat, and I don't know, we call them pitches, so pitch would be like you come up with a startup. You propose it to investors. More often than not, when I sit at a pitch, there's a lot of Industry experts that'll sit there and just say something like, have you thought about this call?
51:51
You thought about this call. Have you thought about this licensing cost? Have you thought about this litigation cost? It turned into a whole lot of. Exactly what you're saying? Why aren't those included because they eat? It's by far. Yes, like a lot of entrepreneurs get optimistic about Revenue, right?
52:10
Like, they think that they're going to make more that they're actually going to make? Just as often. Too optimistic about costs. Right, and when you? You know, I have a lot of friends that are in what we call private Equity. It's a private Equity is less startup, but more like what we call mid-market firms.
52:30
Um, not major corporations, but well developed about small businesses. I mean. So much of what they do is do due diligence on these type of things, right? So absolutely. So? Those, like going back to your list of the elements of your financial model, where those costs be like part of the cash inflow outflow, or would it be part of their full accounting?
53:03
How would you account for those costs? That's my question. Yeah, so I mean, that's a really good question. And the answer is, it depends technically on how you produce the income statement in the cash, those state so technically, you could do it either way. You could do it on a cash basis.
53:20
You could do it on a cool basis. You just need to be consistent. Okay, most people start with the cash bases. That's what I said earlier, and you would just literally put projections in for how much cash. I have to spend on a license and costs right now. Eventually, what people end up doing is in a projecting on a cool basis?
53:40
As well, right? I would ideally show you how to do projections on a cruel basis, but that's not sensible. Since you guys haven't seen it, but the underlying concept of projection is the same. The difference in how you prepare it depends on whether or not you know casual. So, I'm being agnostic about it for now, but you could do it either way.
54:03
Sounds good! Thank you, thank you! I just want you guys to get the point of the next hour and a half. Is the no two type of accounting systems exist, and then think about the benefits of doing the due diligence and writing your problems down and thinking about which sense.
54:17
Can you, you? I think you kind of mentioned this with the the example of the raw materials, but how would you in accrual accounting handle defer revenue through, like grants or subscriptions. Would that be handled the same way? So, yeah, it's a deferred Revenue. So, what you would do is, we just call it unearned revenue.
54:35
So, if someone pays you up front, let's imagine that you have a newspaper subscription. And. It's for 12 months, so I have an obligation to give you your newspaper over the next 12 months, but you pay it all up front. Right. What I'll do is I'll debit cash because you pay me the cash and I'll credit a liability on unearned Revenue.
54:55
And then every month, or however time passes as I perform the service of delivering newspaper. I'll produce the liability time. For anybody that's been paid on tonight, it's totally okay. That's how we do it. We recognize the liability and the liability turns into Revenue over the time period in which I actually understand.
55:22
Is there a rule of thumb of when a company should move from? Um, cash into accrual. It's supposed to have them through. I don't know if I've had this. Many people interested in accounting, but I, this is making me happy, um. My answer is. You should probably know it at the beginning.
55:39
Like, my biggest worry, is that, like, people don't, and then they get caught, right? Cuz they get three or four years in, and next thing you know they're going to, you know? The, you know, maybe they're an accelerator, and they're talking to the administrator trying to find an accountant and turns into a scramble to figure all this out, right?
55:57
Um. Does it matter in year one? Like, does it fundamentally matter? No, but? I think. This is more of a philosophical statement, but we're moving into a world even more so with AI, where it's about data and information quality, and so starting at the beginning and thinking about the type of information and accounting systems you might want to have three or four years now as opposed to waiting, trying to play catch-up.
56:25
Tells me that, like, I think if you're a startup firm, it's still relevant you to take it into accounting device. It's never too early. Right now. Can you get away with it, and you're one or two like, yeah, sure. I can prove to you, and if we get time, I can prove to you that there's not a fundamental difference in year one or two there definitely is near 10, right, but you can get away with it.
56:49
Right, but I don't think that means that you shouldn't plan for the future that makes sense. Okay, you might not like that, cuz it's a little idealistic, right? But you're gonna get to a point three or four years in where you're going to have a choice. Right. It's not gonna be like when you hit the 1 million Mark in revenue or there's a hard and fast rule, right?
57:08
I mean, it depends on who you're working with, like some banks required. Yeah, you decide IPO, then you pretty much have no choice. Right, right? And you're under. I mean, the the point is that? Technically, only public firms have a regulatory requirement, and that's overseen by the SEC Security Exchange event.
57:29
A commission, but? Private firms, even though they don't have to. They still produce accrual accounting statements all the time. Right non-profits at all time, right? So there's plenty of reasons to do it, and so. It's never too early. Now, I get a different question all the time, which is like, what is the intrinsic value to me?
57:51
About doing accrual accounting, as opposed to presenting it to external investors, right, which is a fair point. But there is lots of stuff you would learn about your fixed assets right about how you're managing your cash flows versus your economic performance. That would give you insights to get to sell.
58:12
But yeah, there's no, it's not a million dollars or anything like that. The technical answer is the big difference happens when you start generating a lot of fixed assets when you have a lot of inventory. When you have a lot of accounts, foreseeable revolved because you're managing pay, it receivables with your customers.
58:28
That's when you tend to get a pretty big difference. Richard, thank you, which you probably don't in year one, right? Like, that's fine, but you might in year three or four, right? Uh, Alan. Yes, um, everything that he said has really written resonated with me. I have a I started a food shelf, um, with, like nine locations and we operated on on the cash plan.
58:54
And, uh, but, but at the same time, we, uh. Uh, we had an account that was doing our accrual and how important it is, even if you're a non-profit. I mean to have a cruel County. Um, I mean, as as the CEO, I operated my cash still because we don't have cash.
59:12
I can't buy the food I can't. I can't operate. So I do both. Both are needed, especially even more. Even you wouldn't think in, like a non-profit, like. A, you know, hoping people, whatever you need, that because every year is a nonprofit in Minnesota, where I'm at, you have to do a 990.
59:30
Yeah, bad statement, which is taken right off your accrual accounting statement. And, uh. And and other other people can see that. And so, even though I operate from a cash, you know, if I have the cash grants. There are other Grant people that give grants that are looking for that they want that, and they they don't just go off.
59:54
How, how Alan's a nice guy or whatever he they want to know the inner workings of that? So, it's both in some instances, and maybe for a period of time. It is, so this is, this is great. Thank you, absolutely. I think two comments before I take the next one there.
01:00:11
Yeah, maybe in the future, like this, you know, engaging on people's interests here, like we could go in, the more cash versus the cruel accounting, because obviously people's interesting? Seems to be gearing that way. Obviously, the downside to approval accounting is the learning curve. It takes a long time to learn.
01:00:25
Alan, you probably don't. It's not an easy thing to pick up. Now, if any of you guys get bored and you sort of take my word for it, and you go, and you look at a corporation. You see their financial statements. There's a 10K. It's called a 10K. If you go on Tesla investor relations website.
01:00:44
You can pull it up, go to Adam e, and you will see the financial statements and you'll see the income statement, which is presented on what we call an accrual accounting method. Then there is a cash flow statement and with the cash flow statement's intention is is Alan was talking about is to reverse engineer what cash accounting would have looked like exactly because they're basically presenting you?
01:01:07
Right, that's kind of your point. Alan, like both, matter. So, I guess, Dave, you kind of asked earlier. It's like, if you do both from the beginning, you're in kind of the best scenario, right? I think I want to emphasize to everybody. Nobody really ever actually. Does pure cash flow?
01:01:24
So, when I was an accounting PhD student like? 15 years ago, 20 years ago, oh my gosh! I thought that, like, you know, people really like Alan, you do pure cash accounting, but of course, like, you really don't, right? Because if you bought a bill, so I bought a house, you know, we all know what those costs are in in, uh?
01:01:46
San Diego. Here you pay whatever you know, not really with mortgages, but let's imagine we paid $1.5 million in cash. Nobody ever says, oh, I had a 1.5 million dollar expense this year, right? What does everybody do? Everybody says, oh, I have another asset called 1.5 million house and then the expense that we write down is the mortgage payment, right?
01:02:11
Cuz we don't assume that just because we bought a house that's all inexpensive, right? So nobody's doing pure cash, right? It's, it's all part of the process, David. I'm kind of working together so. Um, Elizabeth, you had a question before I move on. Yes, thank you so much for this talk, I guess.
01:02:29
Just being cognizant of time, and the fact that we have 40 slides left. I was wondering, would you be willing to stay a little longer and finish your talk. Or should we like the slice to be up on canvas? I just I talk until you believe I have no problem with Sonia.
01:02:43
It's I, I mean, I'll go as far as I'll give you the slides. Um, and I'll try to get as far as I can to respect people that are going to take. Uh, two hours, but people are interested. I'll stick around the problem. Thank you. Okay. So, let's, uh.
01:03:01
Go. Slide forward. So, let's kind of go back into this idea of thinking about projections, and then we can come back to the approval cash accounting when we actually build the financial statement tool. A couple slides. So, really key point about accounting. Every time I have students come into my class, they all the first thing they want to do is look at the financial statements, right?
01:03:22
Let's go look at Tesla. Let's go look at whatever and look at the accounting to represents are. None of that matters. Before you understand the economics first. Revenue expenses. They don't matter until you know what the program does. So, when you develop your own Financial model, first order of business is to develop an operating plan, understand what the business plan of the company is, and how you're going to achieve.
01:03:45
So, we always start Financial models and on the bottoms-up basis. By understanding what this operating plan is. They're typically done on a quarterly or an annual basis. Sometimes, people will do it at a monthly based. Excuse me, if they're really, really, really new? Right, and it's all about thinking about who will execute various strategic elements of the business plan, and then, when, and in what order they will be proved?
01:04:16
And the way that we do. This is through something called Milestones, so Milestones kind of are the Keystone behind the operating, right? So essentially, what you do is you create a chart that lays out all the steps and Milestones for developing your business. You start there before you ever think about translating this to financial members.
01:04:36
Actually, for any account, right? So, like, what are your product development timelines. What are your Market timeline? What about IP requirements? When are you going to hire people right? When should you hire people? This is especially important for startups because it turns out financing events are typically tied to mile.
01:04:56
All right, so get a milestone that reduces the risk, right? But you're not gonna be able to finance your business going forward. Like, Alan said, you're not gonna run out of cash, right? And then you just think practically. Put your Milestones on paper and then make sure that you operate your business plan so you don't run out of cash before you reach the next.
01:05:18
I'm going to show you an example of this as we go, but let me show you one more before I turn to that one. Staffing plan. So, the Staffing plan is to develop a head count that supports the Milestones. So, especially when you start off in a business. People well as of right now.
01:05:35
I guess the AI things are changing, but? Uh, people build businesses, so you need people to support the Milestone. So, as you sit down and you describe the Milestones, you also need to describe the Staffing the requirements you need to meet them. Right. So, sgna is selling General administrative.
01:05:52
That's, like, your Administration, who's in your operations, who's in your marketing, who's your engineers, who's your product development? Right? And if you need to think about what that looks like? Think about comparable companies, right? If you're in an accelerator, an incubator talk to the people next door, right? Mentors mentees.
01:06:13
Things like that can help you understand what those numbers mean. Um. Example. All right, so. Uh, this is, uh, a company. It's an old example, but it's actually pretty useful, because in San Diego, with a lot of medical crises. So? If you think about a med device intended to treat AFib again, this is old.
01:06:37
I'm not expert in this area. It's just for illustration purposes. Um. The treatment is to destroy certain areas of the heart responsible for the electrical signals underlying the disease. Some of you might notice, but me, and you use this thing called an ablation catheter, right? So question, that is, like, how could we think about an operating plan, a stocking plan for developing the medical device?
01:07:03
Right, so it might look something like this. Right. So, the operating plan for this particular medical device? Would be to start with high level Milestones. Right? When do we get proof of concept? What is the product development process? When we have proof of manufacturing feasibility, human studies, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing sales.
01:07:28
All that, right? The operating plan can keep these high levels. They can also break them down into additional granularity, right? So, under all these Milestones, you can have what we call sub milestone. Right? All the assumptions underneath these. Can be wrong. You can update the operating plan as you need to go.
01:07:50
It's a living document, right? And it looks something like this, so this would be something you would do pretty simple again with AI and all the things going on. I'll be doing a lot more fans with this. But this would be like an operating plan done on what we call a Gantt chart.
01:08:06
You could do first again. You can do a much faster than this. This is just for teaching illustration. So, what you do? This is on a monthly basis. Put your business on paper and! Write down your Milestones. So, here you can see the big milestones are in bold proof of concept.
01:08:25
Final product development FDA approval, reimbursement, Market availability, and then under that are a bunch of different. Sub miles. Right? Again, these can change. They often change. Right, you can go. Once you've set this up, you can go back and change and adjust okay. And then, of course. The green illustrates the period of time in which you want to achieve these Milestones.
01:08:55
This process seems completely obvious. You guys would all be completely surprised by how many startups even basic businesses don't do this? You would also be surprised how often when you just force a company to sit down and do this amongst their Founders or the owners of the startup business.
01:09:14
How much they learn about themselves? If you force a team that starts a company to do this together, you actually learn how much they disagree with each other, too. I, I've been in settings with startup Founders where we literally were in a wework. And I said, put this on the board.
01:09:33
Come up with this Gantt chart together. And they debated for like two or three hours. And it was a difficult process, but by the end of it, they were a hundred percent more on the same page than they were the prior six months that they have been raised them.
01:09:50
It's imperative that this type of process happens that you guys understand, so. Any questions on that?
01:10:01
Normally, what'll happen is. People will develop products, cuz they're really excited about the product. And then, once they do, they'll like try to reverse engineer, but each of these steps should have been, and sometimes they're scramble. To have this sort of preemptive organization. Just a question from one of the previous lead watches s, g, and a yes, that's selling General administrative.
01:10:22
So, like using administrative costs.
01:10:29
Thanks, this accounting lingo. Have you ever taken accounting class? You'll learn that it's like. A lot of the first five weeks are about vocabulary as well as I think about business terms, so feel free to interrupt me any time with that. Okay, then with operating plan. It's actually pretty easy to convert it into what we call a Staffing plan, so employees are hired over time.
01:10:53
Basically, what you do is you just take the operating plan and just figure out what your staffing requirements are. Right type of employees, number of employees, and when they're needed. So, the example for the same company? Is? Something like this? So? The top part right here, the blue. Is the operating plan, just a snippet of it, and then the green is the Staffing plan?
01:11:24
Okay, so what you'll do is you'll just take the operating plan and you'll figure out what pieces of the operating plan correspond to different types of Staffing requirements. Okay, so here we take two Milestones that correspond to manufacturing. With manufacturing design, finalized manufacturing process from month 8 to 12.
01:11:47
And then we developed a Staffing plan that kind of corresponds. To that operating plan, so we gradually scale up so that by the time that we're in month 12 as we finalize the manufacturing process, we have all the engineers in Texas. Okay, take your question in one second. It's kind of even easier to see if you try to do the Staffing plan for sales reps.
01:12:15
So, what you do is you kind of look at the operating plan, the Milestones that correspond to the staff needed for sales, and you'll see that there's really no need to have a Staffing plan for sales until you get FDA approval. Once you do that and you're trying to make your product available, it's time to start making sure that you hire yourself.
01:12:37
All right, you can see how they kind of go early. Uh, yeah, question.
01:12:46
Uh, yeah. Do you hear me? Yep, I hear you. Hey, what's going on? Just curious, is there like a standardized application that is used in the industry that can be used to do a lot of this, uh? Signing and calculations for startups, meaning for startups or regular terms. I'm sure there's things built out in a lot of different ways.
01:13:07
For this, I'd have to. I do it so much in Excel for teaching purposes, uh, in illustration purposes, but if I make like a? I'll write it down now, and I'll reach out to the people I know that do this type of stuff and see, uh, sort of, what thing they have, like all these Gantt charts are built out and back in software.
01:13:26
Now that's doable for sure. I still, like, I mean, I guess I'm old school Excel is actually very useful for teaching purposes, but um, I'll, uh, I'll come up and find your recommendations for that type of stuff.
01:13:47
Okay. Any other questions?
01:13:54
We still have 240 here, which means I haven't scared off too many people with accounting that right.
01:14:06
All right. No other questions. All right, so. Couple things there. General idea Staffing numbers based. Of operating plan right now. You can do this over all the operating plan, and you can come up with a cool Staffing plan like something like this, right? Um, again. It's not going to progress exactly like this as you grow out your business.
01:14:31
Right, but it gives you an idea, and you can change and evolve. Now, moving into the market model, which is the third piece. Once we have that now, we got to think about revenues and expenses. We're going to start with revenues as accountants. We tend to always start with revenues because revenues Drive so much of the business and how the business scales.
01:14:54
Here's what, like a top-down Market model, would look like. Now, I recommend doing a top-down Market model, even if you're doing a bottom. Up Market model. Not from a, I guess, someone kind of wrote off. But uh, not. For me, this is the best practice, but? A top-down Market model actually can kind of like, be a reality check.
01:15:20
You know, in the sense that you'll see here in a second, that if your bottom-up Market model says that you capture 120 of the market, then you probably did something wrong, right? But what a top-down Market model does, is it basically just starts with the market, and then it just assumes you're going to get some percent of so you start at the top, which is the market, and then you build your way down to revenues instead of starting at the bottom with the unit and building up to row.
01:15:47
So, for something like this, what you might do this is, um. Asia begin. Right, you might think about a U.S market model. You might make some assumptions that aren't necessary for us to go into in terms of, like how many patients there are. You know how many procedures per parent patients, you know, all, to build up to, like, some estimate about what the total Market size is?
01:16:14
For whatever medical device yourself. Right? Then, from there you get your Revenue numbers by just assuming some percent of the market share. Maybe in year one and two. When you're sort of like growing your product, you assume you get zero percent. And then they're on out. You assume that you grow?
01:16:34
Right? Maybe by the end, you're estimating revenue is at 20 of the forecasted market size. Okay. So, obviously, what's interesting about this is you have to forecast? The market size for the entire us to do this, which has a lot of assumptions have been in as well, but it's useful, right?
01:16:52
But you get a sense of what sort of the upper bound line right? Of course. The issue with this is not very detailed, right? It's just I'm assuming I get some percent of some aggregate, right? There's not a lot of detail behind what's going on. So the Bottom's up kind of goes the other way.
01:17:12
Right? I have no idea how to get rid of that yellow line. Put the yellow line on. Whoever's helping out on the Rady side. If you know how to get rid of that yellow line? Appreciate it! Um, okay. So what we're going to do in a Bottoms Up Market?
01:17:35
Oh, we got more now. Okay, perfect, um, sadant, I think, because you are, oh, never mind, he got it okay, perfect. Okay, uh, let me. Tell you guys a second again there. Anybody have any questions?
01:18:01
Hi, can you hear me? Okay, I can hear you great. Um, I know, we've talked a lot about like products. Does any of this change when we start talking about, like a service business? Um, the underlying concept doesn't change, but if the service. There are definitely different accounting assumptions, but yes, there's there's different ways of projecting and thinking about.
01:18:24
The economics of the financial model that changed, right, like the the Milestones aren't going to be tied as much to, you know, contact thinking about FDA trials and things like this, and a lot more tied to to when you can get your service online. Yeah, so the the idea behind the financial model stays the same economic assumption change?
01:18:48
Thank you. Yeah. Alan. Yeah, thank you, um, it has to do with the previous topic about Staffing. And my question was? Or new startups. How do you come up with? How many people you will need in a future if you're requesting money for the first time? Yeah, I mean, that's a good question, um.
01:19:13
This is where networking really matters. So, um? If you're in an incubator, you know you're at a wework or whatever, like? The bench there your neighbors networking events. If you're an accelerator, your mentors things like that, right? So, it's a lot of. Um. Learning by. People in the same situation, right?
01:19:34
I mean, there's some more involved incubators and accelerators that actually have people that are kind of there to sort of help guide you. Um, sort of Staffing support. Um, I think Chicago 1870, I forget the name of the incubator, but they had a person that was basically in charge of, like, talking to their, like, resident startups, and sort of helping them find staff and guiding them when they need staff, right?
01:20:00
That kind of, you know? Obviously, if if you're just going about it, you'll eventually realize that there's a pressing need to hire someone. And God can dictate when you need to hire someone. But if you're thinking proactively, then yeah, sort of like. Guiding and learning from other people that have been in similar situations since the people that started with definitely.
01:20:19
Thank you. Okay. So the Bottom's up model. So the bottoms Up model is really about starting from the bottom, making a whole bunch of assumptions. And getting your Revenue. Right? Because there's a lot more assumptions going on. There's a lot more. Um, details. There's also a lot more room for.
01:20:47
Things to go bad and good. Um, so much about developing. This is. A lot of times about. This is where it is a signal to potential ambassadors or whatever that you have the capacity to do this. But this is also where your model can. If you do it right, tell you different counter-factional Revenue numbers based off different assumptions, which is a fancy way of saying that if you build your model, right?
01:21:15
You can hopefully change a bunch of assumptions to see what your revenues could look like and say the best case scenario or the worst case. Right. If you build this out the right way, okay, and we'll, I'll show you an example of that in a second. So, what do you do determine the fundamental unit of business?
01:21:35
So, how does your business get the gym the member? Determine the sales cycle. Which is from the time that you develop the product to the time that you receive payment, right? Uh, to Jenny's point, this could be different between a service a product. Um, adoption curve. Right. So, a lot of more complicated, you know.
01:22:00
For example, surgical type instruments. Don't just get sold like a PlayStation 5 and use off the shelf. It might take 6 months for the business to divide, decide to buy more of them. Scale them up, right? That might have to play into your projections as the seller of that support.
01:22:18
Ben. How long does it take to build the commercial effort, then development factors, so Trends? What's going to happen to competition, right? Product Evolution. So, what will happen to your Revenue projections? In the future. When you develop new versions, right? So, if you're projecting the sales for PlayStation 4?
01:22:40
Right, then clearly those sales are going to go down one PlayStation 5. Right, seasonality, scholarly conferences. All this stuff kind of plays. Okay. Now, I used to have some really long example in here. I'm gonna try to actually. Take a recent example from my own experience that I think is a lot more fun to talk about, especially for the people that are.
01:23:06
Looking for a more practical example as opposed to something? Um, cortex booking. So, let me show you that. Instead.
01:23:18
So, can everybody see this? Thumbs up! Someone give me a thumbs up. Yeah, yeah. Okay, perfect. Okay, so? This is an example of one. Now, I wouldn't say that this is the perfect financial model by any means, um. This was shot by the startup that was actually doing this, but it's satisfactory.
01:23:41
It paints a lot of the picture that you would be thinking about when you do this. Okay, so to start out, this is a personal Chef company. So, the idea behind this originally the leases you're seeing here is think about it as like ubereats for, like personal chefs like you go on to the app and you go onto the app.
01:24:00
You pick your personal chef and the menu, and then you plan when that person comes and cooks for you. Was sort of an At Your Service. Ubereats type Uber personal Chef. Okay, so? If you think about the operating plan, it was originally constructed on a monthly basis. So, this is.
01:24:22
From some time ago, um, two years ago. It was done over two years. And basically, what happened was the operating plan consisted of high-level Milestones, like app development. This beta test passed, launched the app, and then obviously make app updates. And then they divide it into project expansion. So, this is when they wanted to Lodge events.
01:24:46
Then, they had multiple different products, you know, the app geared towards corporate events. Toward short-term towards pop-ups. Right, things like that? And then they also broke it down into Market expansion. So, what were the periods in which they wanted to expand in the new markets against Los Angeles, Miami, and Chicago in San Francisco, right?
01:25:09
So these are all just sort of operating plan for how they wanted to expand their business. Now, kind of looking ahead. You'll see that all of this was created into financial statements. What I want to start with before we get into expenses is just the revenue side. So, if you look here.
01:25:30
What they did is they have a Bottoms-up model of calculating total revenues. Okay, you can see why we call it Top Line because the Top Line means the revenues are at the top. Okay. Now, the reason it's called Bottoms Up or the things that go into this is each of these different products, so their revenues consisted of somebody.
01:25:56
If you don't mind, maybe using? Brandon, do you mind? Um. There's five different products from which they were going to generate revenues. From their business, right? So they're going to use the app specifically for people that were in-home dining. The app could be used for corporate events. Pop-Ups. Meal prep things like?
01:26:21
Okay. They calculated revenues for each of those products on the bottoms of basis and the way that they did. That is, if you think here to an Excel. There's a separate tap here in Excel that basically. Calculates what those revenues are sort of behind the surface. So, if we take in-home dining?
01:26:43
That actually links to this. Right, and our customers in home. Okay, so basically what it means is if I want to get revenues for enhance home dieting, it's going to be the price. That I can charge each in-home customer multiplied by the total number of customers that I can get.
01:27:05
Inhale. Because that's my unit. The total number of customers that I get to buy. My personal chef. Okay. And then they build it up on a Bottoms Up basis, so they determined that a number of different features would be crucial for them, building up these numbers, right? So what they did is they started with existing customers?
01:27:28
Which of course at the beginning were zero. And then they made some assumptions about how many new customers they could get each month. Right, so each period. They can go out and they can get new customers by advertising whatever it might be. And then they also made an assumption about what we'll call retention.
01:27:48
So retain Customs by that. What they mean is that they anticipated for every new customer. Some percentage of them would ultimately leak. Go in, not come back to the end. And then they also assumed that they could get big jumps every so often when they went into a new market.
01:28:09
Of course. You can see that this new market expansion actually corresponds to the operating plan. The month January 2024. Of which they decided to open up into a UI. Right? Once they've made all these assumptions. They could calculate the total number of customers that they thought that they could get each month.
01:28:32
100 in March 210 in April, 23rd May 231. You can see that it's increasing because they're assuming that their acquisition rate is better than the number of people depends. Right? That gets them. The total number of people that they think are their customers each period, their quantity, so to speak.
01:28:56
Then what they need to do is just. Multiply by price, right? So you have quantity, and now you need to figure out the price. They have another tab for that. Right? So this is their pricing tab. So, what they did is for each in-home customer. They broke it down into three different products.
01:29:19
One that they called elevated, which is like their premium experience. Well, I guess they should say they're elevated above premium experience. Then they had their premium, which is their middle of the road, sort of better than average, but not Elite chefs. And then there's sort of like everyday shows.
01:29:37
Once they were able to do that, they were able to figure out the price that they could charge within each of those customer segments. And then, what proportion of the customer segment corresponded to each? So, in this case, they made the assumption that elevated orders would be thirty six hundred dollars.
01:29:56
And 15 of their customers would have been. Then, they assume 35% of their customers would be premium, and they'd be paying $1,500. And then standard would be 50, and maybe think of that. Right? If you take the weighted average of that, they basically just came to the conclusion that, on average, they would make sixteen hundred dollars per customer.
01:30:20
Okay if you take that 1600? You multiply it by the quantity that we got in this tab right here. Right, he's average customers. That ends up giving you the monthly Revenue built from the bottoms Up. Again. No, that's a lot. There's a lot of stuff, so let me just take a break there and answer questions about how that came about.
01:30:47
So, how do they even come up with all of these numbers? Like, that's a perfect question, right? So? In-Home customers. So, first off, there were some what we call beta tested. So this March 2023 numbers were actually because in the past, they had beta tested the platform, not necessarily the actual app it built out, like a phone list of potential customers, and they estimated the percent of people in their Market that they think would purchase.
01:31:17
Again. Now, here's what's really interesting about these models, right? They could have been wrong. It could have been totally wrong, right? So, let's assume. That they think I don't know. That their numbers are not quite right, right? They think we call it the customer acquisition. Great percent, right? So, how many new customers on a percentage basis do they think they can acquire each year period, right?
01:31:46
So what they can do, and what's interesting about Excel and other things is? Let's imagine that 80 is too aggressive. Right. So, let's assume that they only did 0.7 instead because you disagree with me. Okay. Well, I can put that in and look what happened. Every number changes. And so did the number the estimates.
01:32:12
Does anybody know why that happened? For those of you that are like familiar with Excel?
01:32:19
Yeah, the formula are linked. Yeah, so if you do good Financial models, every assumption that you make is not hard coded. You're soft coding, right? So basically, what you do is this is referenced as two separate tabs, so you can see it says customers in home C10 monthly. C36, so basically what it does.
01:32:41
Is, it just draws from this number. So, when you change this number, it auto populates. So you can actually go in. Can you change any number you want? Maybe it's 6 everything changes. Right? Now, why do you think that's super useful? It's exactly because when you do accounting for startups, you're so uncertain about the future.
01:33:05
What you actually want to do, and it's why it's a really good question is, you don't want to get the number perfect. You want to think about all the possibilities of what that number could be. And then stress tested. Put all the numbers in and see what different numbers you get.
01:33:21
That makes sense.
01:33:27
Yeah, I had a quick question, uh, so this is a bottom sub approach. Now, in a top-down approach, would I first think of what, my, what Revenue I want to generate? And then think of the pricing. In this case, they have gone with the price decided pricing first. The problem with the top down is you don't even really think about pricing so much you basically just say.
01:33:46
Here's the total market share total Market's 10 million, and you just assume your revenues are some market share. I get 10 of it, right? So my revenues aren't P times. Q my revenues are the Market's 10 million dollars, and I think I can get 10. Right, the Bottom's up is saying, let's not start at the market.
01:34:05
Let's actually think about specifically how many customers I think I can get, and what are my assumptions about the price? I can charge them and build up to a derived and calculated Revenue number. The reason that this is so much more flexible is I can go back in. I can change it all.
01:34:26
I can be like, hey, I actually don't think that the elevated order value is 3, 600. I was being too optimistic. Maybe it's actually 3, 000. That's what happens. The number changes. Right. Everything changes out. You can't do that with the tops up top down model by definition, right?
01:34:45
Because it doesn't allow you to play with the assumptions at all. The bottoms up allows you to play with all these numbers and see. So if you were sitting there and you were like, I'm a startup. And I want to know if I'm going to survive. Until next year.
01:34:59
Well, presumably what I might want to do is go into this tab and pick all like the worst assumption, right? 4. Oracle number. And see, hey, am I still doing okay? You might do something like that if you want to like, really, like, maybe appeal to investors you might come in and put like a really aggressive number and be, like, hey, our best case scenario is pull out.
01:35:23
The point is that it's totally transparent because the bottoms-up model endogenously responds to all the different assumptions you can make. And you can get really crazy with this. Like, this is very interesting because it's really simple. But you can put seasonality in this. You can put a seasonality factor that adjusts if you're in retail for December and January.
01:35:43
You know, you could say, on November 23rd, you think there's going to be a new conference that shows that your product is the best thing ever and change the growth rate, right? You can do a bunch of stuff. It's fully flexible, and you can add and subtract assumptions as you see fit.
01:35:57
Can't do that with a top down? Wait, that's kind of. Yeah, um. Wouldn't some of the assumptions be driven by the market? Sure. You still have to make assumptions in the top down model, of course, right? Because you have to think about what the total market size is the point is that the bottoms Up is much more granular because you're thinking about the specific unit for you, as opposed to just thinking more broadly about some aggregate literature.
01:36:29
Yeah, absolutely. Elizabeth.
01:36:35
Yes, thank you. So, if you're making your base assumption on, say new customers, in this example, by Beta testing, how would you, for example, get your estimation of what percentage of the market you would have for if you're going from top down? Yeah, so I mean, I think that's one of the reasons top down is so problematic, right?
01:36:53
That's like, extremely hard to do. Right, especially if you don't even know what the market is, right? Um. Then you don't, especially if you're a startup in a new area. You don't know what the total possible Market is, and when you go into pitches. You see a lot of discussion from people are like hypothesizing what the market could be like I've seen.
01:37:13
You know, people come up with, like surfboard companies, and they're estimating how many people do we think, surf, and you know, it's like these type of things. It's, it's very difficult to understand, so that's one of the reasons that Bottoms Up might actually be useful. You don't have to.
01:37:27
I always estimate total blame. You can focus more on, like, what do you think you can watch? So, I did this for one of my best friends, she on a CrossFit gym in Houston, right? Thinking about what the total addressable CrossFit Market is, like, I don't know how many people would do CrossFit, but what she could do is think about how many new members she could personally.
01:37:50
Right, and that was easier for her to manage. Now, in her case to, to give you an idea of why this is useful for any small business owner, what she did, and why this type of approach is so useful, she actually in her customers would have been members. But she was able to do was actually figure out what the total number of customers she needed to make sure that, in her financial projections, we haven't gotten to expenses yet, she broke even.
01:38:21
Right. So, what she was able to do was keep playing with these numbers. To come up with revenues and make sure that she understood. Hey, I need at least 150 customers this month, or else I'm not paying my bills. Right, she was able to do that by letting this model sort of figure it out, right?
01:38:42
Which is actually pretty useful. Thank you and sorry to add on. One more question, one of the early caveats you had about the top-down model, was also that you might find yourself overestimating. So say we're claiming 120 percent of the of the market. So with that, so how, in this spreadsheet or in this numbers model.
01:39:02
Would you see that happening because other than I anticipated some having a hand wavy assumed x amount of Revenue? Um, that it exceeds the actual Market. You would need to get that number from somewhere now. Yeah, you could do like, if you do like percentage growth like this. I'm just making an assumption about the growth of my customer percentage if you do that, and you don't assume that it Trails off after, because normally what you do is you have, like, add up demand, right?
01:39:29
So you can assume. Uh, growth rate. But if the growth rate is actually concave, but you assume it's linear, then you'll just project it through the roof, right? So, if you don't allow it to level off, which normally happens if you don't extend out enough years of your projection, then you'll estimate a line to return.
01:39:50
Does that make sense? Chris. No. Is she still there?
01:40:04
Yeah, sorry about that. Uh, so in your experience, top down bottom up. When peop. When people that you've worked with have pitched? I don't know whoever accelerators, people, investors, private Equity, whatever it is. Anyone who's going to be investing? Um. Top down always is like a great way to build the 13-page deck, but bottom up is, like, okay, you've really thought about it.
01:40:30
At what point or how often do? Have you seen these investors say I want to see both and I want to see where they meet, and they better be they better correlate. Yeah, I think I think that's true. I mean, I've actually seen situations at this point where, like, the reason that some of these I've seen this happen that, like, some investors, actually like the bottoms up and this Excel because they take they sell themselves and they play with it and put their own assumptions to see what it looks like, right?
01:40:58
Um, so I think the top down a lot of ways is a reasonable reality check is making people excited. Say, don't need for obvious reasons, right? But I think so much of the bottoms Up isn't just about, you know, making it be as much like when you sit down, you show this to an investor.
01:41:19
Have you thought about how Revited you're actually being generated? Have you thought about the cost, and where is this coming from? Do you understand your business enough to illustrate a reasonable Revenue projection, even if it's not perfect? I think bats were so much as it comes from, right? Cuz, you're gonna be wrong, right?
01:41:36
Like, it's never going to be quite right. Do you understand the burdens of your business enough to build? I've also seen people get caught many, many, many times. Because. The thing about the bottoms Up model is. It's more transparent and showing that you can understand your business. It also is more transparent in the sense that people can scrutize too, right?
01:42:10
So it goes both ways. Copy that? Thanks! Ben um, yeah. So, just so, I'm clear the what you're showing right here on the screen. This is, like, the bottoms Up approach, and then when you scroll up with the other kind of like Revenue estimates that's top down, so this whole thing is a Bottoms Up Foundation mod because it starts this tab right here.
01:42:34
Customers in home is the derivation of quantity, and this is the derivation of P and then basically Revenue right here in home is just this tab right here multiplied by that tab. It Bottoms up because I'm literally starting at like basic assumptions of where price comes from basic assumptions of when generates customers.
01:42:57
Uh, top down model would have been like the total market for people that want personal chefs is 100 million dollars. And I think I'm gonna get ten percent. Okay, so the entire thing's bottom up. This is all bottoms. Okay, okay, thank you. And then, um. Yeah, a follow-up question so?
01:43:15
Obviously, it'll be different for like corporations. But for startups, like, you know, how often or what is typical and adjusting the model projections? This, and how often it's done. Oh, I mean. That's a good question. Not one that. I've like asked everybody, but I've worked with startups that have built this a couple times, and then they start playing with it everywhere.
01:43:40
Because once they have it, and they can move it around and see different. I think you guys are are getting the idea here, but the real benefit to doing this is the flexibility, right. Like, the real benefit is not you. Come out and say, this is exactly. My revenue is that when I build it in, I can test my assumptions and see how that affects my projections, right?
01:44:01
I can figure out what my worst case scenario is, but my best is scenario is. Somewhere in Zeldon, right? That's really the the appeal behind it. So I was, they play with him all the time. Right, constantly sort of like as they get new information going forward. They come back to it, change it, and see how.
01:44:21
And then investors might ask, like, I say, you're giving a pitch my ass to see the actual model that you're using. Yeah, I would be an empirical question to know how often that happens, but I've definitely seen it happen. I've actually been part of the start of those asked for it.
01:44:36
They had to turn it in. And then I know that that person played around with the model to see what they came up with. So I've seen it, right? Um. I won't have it in a pitch per se, right? But most of the time in Pitch, you get such a short amount of time to show the basics on those.
01:44:54
Yeah, no, as far as like the vetting process or something, um, yeah, I mean, I? I've seen my fair share that like to see this for sure. Absolutely! Uh, I know, I got. I gotta exit a couple things. Let me take one more question and then say a couple other things.
01:45:12
Uh, yeah, I have one question. So, what comes up approach seems more, uh, practical and based on right assumptions? How do we do this same approach for top down because it seems more vague like, yeah, top down is vague, right? It's kind of, like that, example I showed you earlier, you're just gonna make some assumptions and use some data to figure out which total Market is.
01:45:32
And then you're gonna make an assumption about your percent of that market share. But of course, that's very difficult to determine. I think I'm gonna get 20% of the market share. You know? Could be optimistic. Like, where does that number come from? Yeah, it's very hard. That's one of the problems with the top down.
01:45:53
It's not as detailed. It doesn't start with unity economics and. Basic business principles. It starts at a very high level, right? So, but if I were the investor, I would probably invest more in the bottom-up approach, right? Because it's, I mean, I can believe it. But if something is vague, why would someone believe in me and then invest in that.
01:46:11
That's something I think that's kind of. Why, uh, being trying to go through the bottoms of sort of nitty-gritty accounting as opposed to the top down, right? Exactly because I agree with you, okay? Yeah, absolutely. All right. Let me say a couple more things. I'm gonna have to go fast.
01:46:28
I understand that some people are normally used to an hour and a half, so I understand if some of you have to go but. Um, I'll stay around until. People decide they need to leave. Okay, so that was kind of an example. So, at that point, you've determined your cost projections.
01:46:46
I want to emphasize with the market model. You can make it as detailed as you want, you can put as many assumptions seasonality Market development. All these sort of things that are specific to your? Products you can do, and that can be different from a service to a tangible product and things like this.
01:47:02
Of course. After that, you have to think about cost. Right, and the cost is specific to the type of firm that you're looking at. Um. But there is a couple different ones that are worth bringing up. The first is manufacturing cost. Manufacturing costs include raw materials and packaging, labor facilities, and equipment.
01:47:22
Of course, those costs are only going to be relevant if you're building a product. If you're in a service, not as much. Opex stands for operating expenditures, so this is like research and development. Sgna, which is selling General administrative, your accountants, whatever and non-production facility costs like things not associated with building the actual product.
01:47:46
Um. Salaries. Are included in both, just depending on what type of salary it is. So, if it's a? You know, the cost or the salary of the engineer or the manufacturer manufacturer? It might be included here. If it's the cost of the accountant, it's probably included in operating expenses.
01:48:08
Just. Right? Um. So, how do you do this? Well, there's a couple things I don't have a lot of time, so I mean, I kind of highlight big pieces. The first thing you do is like, figure out how much you have to pay people, and this one's actually like, not too tough.
01:48:25
So you have a Staffing plan that you already did so? Based off of each of the type of hires that you had, you can figure out what the admiral salaries how much I have to pay them to. Okay. The only thing that I would emphasize here if you decide to do.
01:48:43
This is one of the things that gets missed a lot is. You have to calculate a fully burdened cost, right? And that is, most people make more than their salary, like, are you offering them benefits Healthcare insurance? Things like that? Are you offering them? Computers, desk equipment, whatever it might be.
01:49:04
Um, that can be like. 1.52 times the salary Elizabeth. I understand that it's more expensive to hire new staff than to retain staff. How would you? Incorporate that sort of analysis into this. In terms of, would you? So you're saying you would separate out new hires versus? If you wanted to, you could do that so you could think about your Staffing plan and you could separate out into like you hire versus.
01:49:41
Um, the supper time for people that are retained from prior years. Now, the thing is that, like? Salaries and bonuses increase over time. So, yeah, you might. The new hires might be more expensive because you have to pay whatever the prevailing market wage is, but you still have to account for the fact that salary still increase for your retained staff as well, right, you just different growth rates, right?
01:50:04
I don't know. Like, if you're hiring a new Professor here. You know, it might be more expensive because you have to pay, then prevailing market wage versus existing professors. Just get a three percent increase in right, so just different growth rates and their salaries. If you wanted to now, you could separate them out.
01:50:22
You have to decide if there's enough detail to matter to make that sort of Distinction. But yeah.
01:50:31
Uh, I have a question. You have included, uh, like computers, desks, and equipments, and like. Uh, basically, fully burdened cost per employee, I guess. Uh, yeah, because? Uh, I mean, people. Do people do that differently? I'm gonna be dead honest with you. I do not tend to do that.
01:50:50
I tend to. If I do it, I make separate projections for what I call Capital Equipment, which is, yeah, whatever. Some people can include it in the poorly burdened cost of a staff and call it like part of the country. Right, you can do it either way. This is technically not accurate, but I have seen people, but it's not how I would do it as an account.
01:51:13
People sometimes do that, so you can either include it, or you can do a separate projection that's called like supplies, Capital Equipment, whatever. But yeah. It depends on the level of granularity that you need protections. Okay, so you do something like this. You take your staffing plan, right? Make some salary assumptions, and then you can sort of multiply.
01:51:37
Get the fully burden cost, right? Then the actual cost for your? Salary will just be. The total number of Staff multiplied by the fully burden cost for that. Uh, then you think about manufacturing costs. Right, so manufacturing, so that'll include any manufacturing. Labor that came from the Staffing plan specifically for the manufacturing team.
01:52:06
You also think about facility costs. Right. You'll think about raw material costs, so all these type of costs. Um, I'll show you what that looks like since I'm running out of time, so you'll just project your comps. Right. So, for any manufacturing labor? From the Staffing plan and the salary thing that we just did, you'll just.
01:52:29
Take the total expenses related to that particular employee. Then, you'll figure out whatever and project any cost you have for your manufacturing facilities. Right, there's one important point about projecting facilities. When you project? Your facility costs or your facilities expenses. Please keep in mind that. Buildings don't sort of increase in size linearly.
01:53:02
What I mean by that is you might project based off the size of your operations that in year three, you need a 1100 square foot facility in your floor. You need a 2640 into year five. You need a 4370. Just know that what firms typically don't do is increase the size of their building every single year that they expand?
01:53:26
Right, don't normally sort of occasionally every couple years. Build out. Into a facility that's technically bigger than what they need, and then they'll sort of grow into it. Just know that. That's important because when you sort of. Forecast these, you might end up paying for square footage that you don't need yet.
01:53:50
Right, so you can see here. They only needed 2640 square feet, but they had a. 3000 square foot. Facility that they had to pay for. The next year, they expanded to 4370 where they projected they would, but they bought a 15, 000, though. Obviously, they only needed 5 000, but since they're not going to move every year.
01:54:14
They expanded into a much bigger one and then just keep that in mind. That facility costs tend to go in steps, not legit. And then raw materials, so things you need to build your products. Add that all up. You get your cars, so you're manufacturing? Next one operating so r d staff?
01:54:38
Uh, your SG a, which is like your accountant's things like that. Get your fault line. So, what's your r d staff? Any costs? In this example, you might have with clinical trial or anything that's not manufacturing related if it's expenses. Um. Include your staff and your facilities costs. Add those up.
01:54:59
You get your operating cost. So does cogs, um, essentially, just your manufacturing cost that you'd shown in the previous. Yeah, yeah, so? I'm skipping over this, because, oh sorry. Um, let me answer it because. I think. Cost of goods sold as a very specific accounting terminology. So, what costs the goods sold for accountants typically means any costs related to the production of a product?
01:55:28
Okay, so that's how we calculate cost of goods sold, but you'll learn an accounting class we call that full absorption costing. You could do it different ways, though, so you could do variable versus fixed costs, so there's different ways of calculating it is the problem. Um, that's why I'm glancing over it.
01:55:48
Um, when you hear most accountants, talk about it. What they mean is just all the costs related to manufacturing a product, whether or not that's a labor, the raw materials. Whether it's fixed or varied. Right. I put it in the slide because I'm going to give you the slides, and it is a term that people use.
01:56:09
But like people use it very? Sort of. Loosely sometimes, if that makes sense. Hey, so it depends on how precise you want to get. Thank you! What is a analogous term for cogs and service industry? In the service history costs gets old. Isn't the cost good? Sold, right? Because you're not, you know, you have?
01:56:35
Yeah, you have no inventory. But then, how do you calculate, like, the amount of service charged, like, I mean, you, you call it, just service charged, or something like salary expenses, right? Okay, you got your control and you got to pay your employees with your Consultants. You pay an expense, right?
01:56:52
Yeah, they're just not. I mean, it's an interesting question you're like in your brain. You're thinking, like, are my Consultants, like my inventory basically, and they're almost like my cost of goods sold, but that day would just be expenses. And then, as the consultant works for me and generating that service that I take the expense, right?
01:57:11
Okay. So, just just to kind of add on, because, um, because there's there's a term like kogum, right, cost of goods manufactured? Would that be the cost to manufacturing cogs would include, like, uh, any sort of markup? Or, um, well, the difference between cost of getting sold and cost of goods manufacturing.
01:57:27
Even though they're kind of the same is, you can have costs goods sold for retail. Which just absorbs the cost of like acquiring the? The already manufacturing product. And shelving, and all that stuff is included, whereas costs of big sold was manufact. Absorb all the costs related to the manufacturing of the product.
01:57:50
Right. Again, that's like, kind of an accounting class a little bit more in depth. But yeah, so you get my point. This is, there's a little bit more in depth here from now. What I want you guys to think about in this is there's a bunch of costs that go into manufacturing the good that you want to make sure you destiny, right?
01:58:08
Okay. Once you have? Revenues that you did. And once you have the expenses, then you take the difference. Your revenues, manufacturing costs, operating expenses. Well, you get to operating income. So, it's like this revenue is minus expenses. You get your pre-tax operating profit. Okay. Um. Spree tax operating profit.
01:58:35
The only difference in operating profit and net income would be if you have any financing costs. See if you have to pay back debt interest expense. Things like that, and you have to pay tax. Then, you get something called net income, which is the income suit Elizabeth. You mentioned earlier, that um expenses are something that people especially early on tend to underestimate or overlook.
01:58:56
Do you have a list of commonly overlooked or? A comprehensive list of expenses that people can look at. So, in the vein of, you don't know what you don't know. Yeah, so let me show you something. I'm actually we have 190 people here. Still, after all the accounting, that's.
01:59:13
I'm surprised. So many people like accounting, it makes me happy. All right, so? Go back here, right? So? What is? I'm not. There's a lot of details here, right? So some of the stuff that we put in here was, you know, salary expense, travel, and entertainment software development, licensing, insurance.
01:59:35
To that point. There are often so many expenses that people don't think about. Typically, I advise putting a miscellaneous expense, which is just some percentage just as a catch-all for anything you might have missed can be conservative. Right, so I actually just sort of like, get ahead of the curve and just put a miscellaneous expense tab in.
01:59:55
And it's just a catch-all for all those types of ones that you wouldn't have thought of. Thank you. Yeah, I would almost always do that, because if you're doing something like this, and someone says, hey, did you think about this expense? Elizabeth, you can be like, oh, you know, what?
02:00:09
I didn't really get a point, but I have a buffer for that expense that's embedded in the rejection. If that makes sense? Helen. Yeah, do you consider software, um, a service or product? Software. No, I mean, it's got a little flavor of both, right? Yeah, if he's like, purely sell for a company, you know?
02:00:36
Uh, I mean. Yeah, I mean, I guess it all is how you think about it, right? It's not a product in the strict sense of, like, you're manufacturing it at scale and selling it to customers. So you're it's more backend development, and then it's almost done more reminiscent of the service, right?
02:00:52
So, I guess that's where you think about SAS and software service. And a lot of those are going to be done on like subscription models and things like that. As opposed to. You know? Manufacturing the same software every time you sell it in customer. All right. Okay, thanks. Uh, just follow up to Elizabeth's question.
02:01:14
Would you is there a general? Of percentage that you would recommend for miscellaneous costs. Like, what do people? How much do people generally Miss? I don't know what I do here. Um. The 10 month. I gotta go back and see what I did. So miscellaneous. 16, 30s. Forget, I think I may have hard-coded this one, um, based off of.
02:01:48
The number. I don't, necessarily. I think it's kind of. In this case, it was business specific, right, just based off some of the leftover ones. I don't. This is something that I personally do, so I don't know if there's as much of like a guiding principle behind this, but Based off the industry.
02:02:06
Like, I guess, in this example, I had been around them enough that I just sort of had a window or a variant in my head that I thought they could be missing by. Right, as opposed to some sort of systematic rule. It's a good question, though, right? Um, it also depends on like, how parsimonious you think you are with the other expenses, of course, right?
02:02:27
Like, if I wouldn't have included travel and entertainment. Then, of course, miscellaneous expensive had to be higher, right? So, it's the catch-all. It depends on. How granular you made all the other expenses? Yeah! Now, here you can see that I did the revenues for all the different products. I also did cost of revenues.
02:02:48
For all the different ones as well. Now, this would be more like. I mean closer in spirit, so this is just, you know? A little bit more of a service, right? But I separated out the operating expenses as sort of the salary travel software development licensing from the cost of revenues, which is a little bit more like, what is the actual cost of providing each in-home service?
02:03:15
Where the cost of revenues consisted of the? Individual times. You had to pay the chef. Right? So I did it Nick, like, just to give you an answer to your question earlier. This is done on a variable costing basis, though. Um. Which is slightly different? It's not cost of getting sold.
02:03:35
How, like firms will do it. It's basically well, at least for financial reporting. It's done on a not everything that's related to manufacturing. It's only the variable portion that's related to manufacturing. In this case, just producing the in-home experience. We could talk about that live. Okay, so I'm basically out of time.
02:03:56
So, let me make a couple comments for the people that need to get out of here. And then, I will. Stay around for. Other people. Um. So, only thing is a cash flow statement. We're not going to get into this, but that depends on whether or not you did it on an accrual accounting method or a cash accounting.
02:04:14
If you did your projections on a cash basis. Then, you don't have to worry about this. If you did, do the income statement on an accrual basis. We have this additional step where? Create cash flow statement as well. Um.
02:04:30
What I want to say to wrap up is revenues always take longer than expected. Margins are never great as you think. Operating expenses are typically higher. Capital needs are higher. My point is that if you build these bottoms up model, you can see how all of your assumptions work out.
02:04:48
You can test and validate your assumptions from the bottoms up and sort of like putting the accounting and the modeling on. Paper allows you to see how that all works out and how things change. It allows you to be more flexible and plan better as as. Okay, now there is so much more to this than what I can do in two hours.
02:05:07
I didn't even get the chance to tell you where cruel accounting and cash flow County can deviate, but the idea of building this up so that you can be sort of more. Rigorous. What you're doing with a lot about it in terms of how you think about your own business and how you can present it excellent?
02:05:25
Last point. That was a lot of information, like way, way, way more than I would ever expect people to take away from in two hours. I just want you to like, know what's out there. Like, you guys just have to do a reflection. There's no test, like? I just want you to know, like, what the tools of business and accounting is sort of sitting beyond what you've seen before that you can do, or you can learn if you continue to keep going right, sort of.
02:05:52
Get an idea of what you don't know that you don't know, okay? And that's pretty much what I got for you guys, so I can answer any other questions you guys have happy to stick around. Answer as much as you're interested. Like, I said, this would be by far the most dense, I would guess.
02:06:10
Um. But again, no expectation that that you've learned everything just more for your knowledge. I certainly feel like I'm the most dense, so it was a great lecture, though it's definitely the most dense I always like. I always I've done this for four or five years, and you can tell, like, some people tend to leave a little bit earlier, and I totally expect that, I think.
02:06:35
It's I. I've always wrestled with the idea. Bringing it down a little bit and just focusing on a couple Concepts that people could really grab and really feel like they took away from it. But eventually, I settled on the fact that, like. I want you guys just to, like, see what the Horizon looks like so, then hopefully you guys inside the road that way.
02:06:57
And, like, I a lot of your other classes will be a little bit more, you know, conveys than things that you feel you can take away start from end, so? I don't know, it's. It's a decision. I guess that I made. Hopefully you guys are okay with that, but it was great to get excited about what is up there, not just.
02:07:15
You know, Basics? Can I ask you a question what I mean? Probably a simple question. What's the difference between revenue and cost of Revenue or so, so? Cost of revenue is an expense basically okay, but it's the expense that you incur in the process of generating revenues. So we mean by cost of goods sold is basically like, I'm manufacturing a product when I sell the product.
02:07:40
I'll generate revenues. The cost of that Revenue that I generate from selling the product. Is the cost that I incurred to manufacture it in the first place? Right? But then, it's like it can get tricky, right? So, like, is a marketing expense? Is that a cost of Revenue or not, right?
02:08:01
Maybe, cuz, it's kind of a cost that I incur in the process of generating revenues, but like. Okay, you know, we have to make some assumptions sometimes, right? It's easy to think about in manufacturing because labor. Raw materials. All those are clearly revenues that you incur in the process of generation.
02:08:22
Can you just show what a cash flow statement would look like? I mean, I just, I mean, you just brushed up very quickly. Would you want to see, like, a, a real one, or do you want to see, like a startup one? Uh, startup one. Okay, so?
02:08:39
Here's the thing about the income statement, let's see who that is so. If you look at? The cap, like a cash flow statement like? The problem with accrual accounting is the following? If I want to provide an income statement. And let's say that I spent two thousand dollars. On buying a facility.
02:09:05
Okay, I spent two thousand dollars in cash. But that's not recorded as an expense on the income statement. It wouldn't be an expense. The reason it's not recorded as an expense is when I do a cruel accounting. I'll credit cash debit what we call property plant equipment. So I won't record an expense instead.
02:09:26
I don't know if you guys have heard of this before you take an expense called depreciation, like over the life of the asset. Yeah, the problem is, is that income? Won't reflect cash because you spent the 2 million in cash, but the income statement doesn't take that into account because it didn't record it as an expense credit.
02:09:46
Yeah, so with the cash flow statement where you have to go back and do is, you have to make. Jasmine's. All right. For all the times that you basically had a situation like that ready. Yeah, so in real life, what you do is you start with income, and then you reverse all the parts of income out that were non-cash.
02:10:07
You used an actual accounting class. It's like my MBA student's least favorite function, right? But you basically just have to reverse out any of the parts that of income that were non-tasualties. So if you got if you got revenues that you projected that came from accounts receivable? And you have?
02:10:25
Remove all of that because it wasn't cash, right? Yeah, industry, of course. The reason that you have to do that to if you did the original income statement on a cash basis. You don't have to worry about that because the cash flow statement and the income statement, basically the same damn.
02:10:40
Yeah, if you did the income statement on a crawl basis, the reason that even major corporations will always produce cash flow. Statement is because you still need to know how much cash you have, cuz that's what pays the bills. Yes, don't pay bills with income. You pay bills in cash.
02:10:56
Right? Yeah, in other words, you didn't take an expense for buying that two million dollar building in the accrual accounting world. But you did in the cash rule. That's two million dollars that you don't have to pay your employees, you know. Yeah, I got it because it was spent, and it's still like a capital cost.
02:11:12
So exactly. Absolutely. So, that's basically what it looks like. Now, you can look at this if you want. It turns out that there's very little difference between cash accounting and. Acrylic counting at the beginning? Because the difference between cash and cool accounting are things like Capital Equipment counts receivable, but they don't tend to happen in year one.
02:11:34
They do tend to happen by the time you get to year six and seven, right? Yeah, buyers want credit. You buy more fixed assets you. Maybe you are doing an AI company and you started as a service, but now you got to buy the gpus in the Mainframe and the energy centers.
02:11:51
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that was good. Yeah, thanks. I'm so sorry, this is going to be a multiple question, um, number one. I guess the short version, the shortest question is, wouldn't all these be? I know we didn't touch on this, but wouldn't all that be accounted for in a balance statement or a balance sheet balance sheet will show you the assets, though, right?
02:12:11
Right. So, a little bit away from the startup. But yeah, if you had a real firm if you're interested in the accounting, there will be a balance, so there's a third thing that firms produced called the balance sheet that. That they tried to list the value of their assets employees, right?
02:12:28
As well as their liabilities for sure. And then, I guess, um, on a more overarcher level. So, if this is the very? To. Accounting for a dummies version of this, then what's the next step? So if everything it's everything from this two-hour lecture to? Accounting, and the most at the highest level.
02:12:51
Where do we start? Oh, great question. Practically speaking. The reason that? Are you accounting for startups is? There's. 240 people, and it's like trying to provide some perspective and everybody can get something on. So, even if, like, you never want to see accounting again for your life. If you decide that you want to create a startup like at least, those people know that they should probably know a little bit about accounting.
02:13:20
It's useful, right? If you're a little bit more in the numbers and you really want to get into this? You need to take an accounting. You should take an intro accounting class like you should know like. This is the language of business. This is how people communicate about business transactions, right?
02:13:35
So? If you want to get into business or be business adjacent, like, I know. You know, I have my friends. Some of my students that come in there in biotech or whatever. Maybe they're the CEO. They, they don't like it. They find accounting to be a painful 10 weeks, but they come back to me two years and be like.
02:13:54
This is one of the most valuable costs that I've taken, because now I can actually talk to my CFO. I can talk to my controller. When I pick up the financial times, I know what these. Term review, right? So, I think. You know, the micro MBA is about learning a little bit about business, but it's also sort of where they can sort of wet your appetite a little bit too, right?
02:14:13
And so, in my view, part of my goal is to convince you guys to actually take into accounting class. I guess. Ideally, you come be an NBA rating to take my class, right? But if not, you find some Avenue and you sort of dive in and. Invite the bullet and take that and take class.
02:14:31
So, I guess in terms of the Long View, then what? What kinds of people will you say into accounting else in a very non-discipitated course versus MBA versus, um? Accounting through, say, UCSD extensions. Where would each of us fall? All of you could easily handle an intro, or I guess, in terms of where we are and where, where our goals are all of you, can?
02:14:56
I mean, I think the intro accounting cost of the MBA that I teach is well within what all of them has professionals can hear. It's well within what you guys are capable, and um. I think it's like anything. It's for some people they really like to think about the world.
02:15:10
This way, there's other people are there. Don't enjoy it as much in the process, but are really glad at the end of the day, right? Um. I think if you are business adjacent in some capacity, like you will be dealing with people that did take the class, and that allows you.
02:15:30
Like, so much of an intro accounting class is learning business terminology, even today. What's this, TNA? What's comes? What does all this stuff mean? Especially you talked about as well, right? So you know? I think it's a good idea just to kind of dive in and just do it, but I've also been accounting for 20 years, another PhD, so I'm probably a little biased, right?
02:15:54
But there's definitely no hurt just going for it. And remember, like every company that you see is public, like they've produced Financial statements online. This is how the financial press talks about. So, it's only going to open your eyes to a whole new world. Even if it's not Starbucks.
02:16:13
Thank you. Good. Yeah.
02:16:32
So, my first question is. Uh, stem from the.
02:16:46
You can, like, make me show things that you don't want to show. Um, good things in a way that benefits you. Be sure that your company is good as well. Is that? Look better and carefully within the limit of accounting. So I caught, like after that, because your microphone, or you see the mirror, your microphone is, like, very.
02:17:17
Low, so I can't help. Can you give me the two sentence? Um, maybe I'll I'll try it. Um, so my changing how you show?
02:17:32
Uh, some companies. Show that they are current accounting, or I mean, like the company, I got you now, so Creative Accounting is a thing, right? So people do so. One of the things that you learn about accounting is a lot of people think accounting is, like, some sort of science, and it's just governed by sort of objective rules.
02:17:55
The reality is accounting is very subjective. Okay, I'll give you an easy answer. I think, Elizabeth, you asked about the balance sheet. I'll tell you what the balance she did. It has assets and liabilities and shareholders that the purpose of the asset section is to give some information about, like, what the value of certain assets on.
02:18:14
I'm here ready our business school. What would you put the value of this building on a balance sheet?
02:18:25
Oh, it's like a million ways. You can do it, not a million, but you can think about what is its current market value. What is the value that we paid for it? What would be the the amount that we would have to do if we decided to? Remanufacture it.
02:18:37
There's so many assumptions that go into every number. Now, when there's a lot of assumptions, guess what else means? There's a lot of flexibility, right? So, there's a lot of creative Accounting and Creative accounting gets a little too much. You just get that right fraud that certainly exists, right?
02:18:55
There's many instances Worldcom Enron. There's plenty of that going right now. Where is? Where is the line between fraud and creative counting that just slightly is within the rules? It couldn't be more Grace, right? Um, and it's fascinating anytime you have subjectivity and assumptions. You have people that work around that.
02:19:22
Yeah, so basically.
02:19:30
I mean, there's always cause and benefits to anything you do, right? Like, you're taking money, right? Like? You make your value seem higher, right? In some sense, it makes you want to invest. In other sense, like? You have obligations behind intentionally. What you do with money if you want to get more financing in the future, right?
02:19:54
So, like, there's a lot of things. Gonna follow through at the promises. At least to some degree, you have to hit those miles so. Um, I think that's why having models like this that you don't really have to get creative. You just say, look like this is the best case.
02:20:10
This is the worst case and I'm transparent with my assumptions.

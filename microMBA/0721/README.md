00:01
Start looking slow and then accelerate, so people are showing up. Uh, can catch up so. Hi everyone, my name is Owen. I'm professor of the ready school for the last time. You know, slightly more than 20 years? Um. And my task is to talk to you about strategic marketing.
00:23
In just three hours, which is? Tall order. So, what I've done is I've picked? Things that if we can. Um, get through. Will probably allow you to understand everything else. So, um? We're going to. You'll see why, why? I say, strategic. You'll see what I mean by marketing. Um.
00:51
Talk about today. We have an hour and a half we'll talk about. Um. Positioning really, so we'll start with and we'll see how? We'll get there, which is probably the most important theme. In certainly marketing, but also in business. I know Finance professors will tell you that financing is important.
01:13
And yes, we need to manage people, so that's important. But really, you see what I mean in a bit? Um, it's all about positioning. And in our meeting on Wednesday, we'll see how we apply positioning in the context of branding, which is a tool. Uh, we're using marketing, and we'll see what what I mean by then.
01:35
Hopefully, it'll get you a sense of what is marketing. Um. But um? We can start with this question. Or y minus units. Question so?
02:10
One of the things yeah. We also move advertising, publicizing, trading, implementing. Influencing value as advertising. Sales. Say that again. Okay. Social media, catching one's attention and science. Support sales.
02:55
Land Management and networking, his story.
03:08
So, this is all nice, I would say. Somewhat, not surprisingly. Biased. An incomplete view of marketing. Uh, so hopefully. When we're done today, you'll see what I mean. But almost everything you said. Um. Our applications. Right that their applications, they're they're in. The heart of marketing is what we're going to cover.
03:40
In the heart of marketing. Is creating value? What do I mean by this, if if you ask yourself, why do firms exist, and by the way? When I say firms, it doesn't have to be for-profit. It could be non-for-profit everything. I'm going to talk about today is true for for-profit, not-for-profit for large firms, small firms for how to Market yourself as an individual.
04:08
For how to Market countries, planets, Galaxy. It's all the same, okay, the same principles we're going to cover today. Apply, and that's I think. Pretty unique. And so firms exist. Really to create value. So, from a finance perspective, you'll say, oh, firms exist to create value to shareholders. But how do firms create value shareholders?
04:32
They have to make money. How do firms make money? People want need to want to pay them. Right, why do we pay a firm? Why do we pay a company to? For their service for their product. Why do we pay UCSD for education? Right, we pay part of the social contract of money we pay.
04:56
While brand image is is going to, you'll see. We'll talk about branching in two days. Brand image is going to help. But was, we'll, we'll see exactly how it helps. But really, we're paying to receive value. Right, the social contract of money is. I'm willing to pay you if I get value in return.
05:15
Whether it's a good a service. Information, educate whatever it is.
05:23
Yes, exactly. The exchange, right? The social exchange? So firms exist to create value. And again, I'm using firms in a more very general term. How is value created? How do we create value? What does it mean to create value?
05:54
Connecting people with something they need. That actually is? Right utility. By the way, let's talk about utility for a second utilities and economics term. Utility in its basic shape is an ordering of preferences. Right, so utility from economics standpoint is another term for Value. But because utility is a very specific model, I'm not going to.
06:19
We don't have to commit to that model if you don't believe that utility is a good enough representation. We'll talk about value. But really. Um. We had, I think Andrew had a comment here to help a client. With the product or service they need. So really value. Is created when?
06:44
I don't have a side face, so I'll just answer it. Value is created when we satisfy a need. If we're hungry, and somebody gives us food that's value. If we want to stand out socially and wearing instead of genes will do that, that's value. Right? If we want to get, we want to learn a profession in going to school to learn that.
07:07
Will satisfy that need. That's value. By. Happens when needs are met. Okay, that's that's really the definition of elements. By the way, it's the only definition that really matters. Because then you say, how do you occur Valley? Well, well, let's satisfy some needs. People have lots of different needs.
07:31
Some needs are kind of pretty uniform you can think of if you know Maslow's hierarchy of needs we need. We need safety. We need survival. We need to socially belong. We need. We need some identity. Those are, you know, you can find across people. Yeah, so we'll talk about consumer expectations in a second because needs and expectations might not always be aligned, right?
08:02
So? Everybody needs to survive, but what it means to survive for different people could be could be different, right? There's heterogeneity in the specific things that would meet the needs. If if you know my? Sister picked her car because it was red. I'm like, what. Like it was red.
08:24
I'm like, really. That's why you picked your car. She's, like, yes, like, okay, your needs are different than mine. Right, and and the car might satisfy multiple needs, right? It might satisfy getting, you know, transportation need, but it also might. Might serve. Some self-identity needs or social needs or whatever so, so products and services can satisfy multiple needs.
08:50
And people are heterogeneous, which makes life really interesting. Like it allows you to? I guess we'll call later. It allows you to properly position your product towards, which needs you, you think. It should meet to create the most value. You know, one one, you know, in a I used to ask this.
09:11
I don't know if it said works, but I used to ask, like, what are candles for?
09:25
Ambiance. Romance. Snow decoration. Romantic beaners, right? See that? It's like, you know, for thousands of years, candles were just light. How do they become? Products that satisfy these other needs. Like, who decided Kendall's signal the romantic dinner? Society does right? How does society move to ascribe? Kind of another need to.
10:00
A product is an interesting process. Life is really interesting and dynamic. You could. You can peek and we'll do that. You could pick some probably save. What is this doing? So, this is like, this is all about value creation. Somebody decided. Either implicity or explicitly. That's putting a candle would make the dinner more romantic.
10:25
Right, books, movies, media, whatever people saw that, and said, oh, that that might work, and so it's, it's a common signal now. It works. And companies that make candles decide said, well, how do we? How do we compete with each other? Oh, I know it's romantic dinner. Let me add some good scent to the candle.
10:48
Our candles are going to be different than just the normal candles that are sold there. Which is sort of one aspect of positioning where people talk about is differentiation. So many people can be creative and try to differentiate by. Adding attributes to our products or whatever. Okay. In general, this crazy flow chart is the entire marketing process in abstract.
11:14
I'll sort of go over it very quickly. We are in, uh, three hours. They're going to talk mostly about the top part here, and we'll talk about branding. So, what is the tough part. The top part is what I call Market opportunity analysis. The market opportunity analysis involves analyzing your customers.
11:33
What their needs are. And how are they heterogeneous? We'll talk about that. Analyzing your competitors and analyzing yourself. Hey, what do I can? What can I bring to the table to meet customer needs?
11:56
The summary of this kind of strategy point, the customer selection and positioning, involves kind of segmentation targeting oppositions. We'll talk about that. These top part is often called the three C's of marketing. If anybody asks you if you've seen it, now you've seen it. It's basically. Customers, competitors, and Company.
12:20
Then, once you have the strategy, there's a market research because a lot of the questions are empirical. Like, how do we know how much customers value this, like we can guess, but that's a hypothesis? As many of you, I hope, know. Uh, we treat. We try to treat life in a scientific way.
12:40
Hypotheses are just hypotheses they need to be tested. Uh, branding is another marketing tool. It's separate from the other tools for this kind of special. And then there's the marketing tools. The tactics you can create products or services. You can distribute them in a certain way. Get them to the customers you can communicate about it if you want.
13:02
Let customers know that you're creating value, and you probably need to price your offerings as well, because uh distribution is also called placement. This calls this is called the four Ps, which are the tactics. So if anybody says, have you heard of the 3c4p of marketing? Now you have.
13:22
Okay, that's that's what it is at the end of the day. Okay. Um, at the end of the day. We also need to know that we're doing what we think we're doing. Right, so we have some measurement system at the end here. Customer management and satisfaction? Um and. Should inform our strategy.
13:48
Right, we hoped customers would do this. Based on our research, they should like this. It turns out a different set of customer likes this. We should maybe adjust our strategy, right? So, this is a living breathing process. That we keep updating based on feedback we get from the market.
14:04
In other words, based on data. Does that make sense? We have strategy tactics. Whatever in this three hours, we'll talk about the top part and we'll talk about branding on Wednesday. Anybody has any other questions about anything? I'm happy to chat outside classical. We won't have time to cover the rest.
14:30
Where do I recommend pulling data from? Okay, so? Uh, you eat, there are, you know, depending on the question you're asking there either is existing data? Or, you have to generate the data by doing active market research. Right, so it really depends. What question you're trying to to test or answer?
14:50
Um. Many companies that already exist have data. They can learn a lot from. You can also. Run experiments with your customers to learn. More correctly. Any causal relationship you're interested in? But when you're starting out, then you don't have data. Then you probably have to go out and do active market research, which again is sort of in this component.
15:13
Here, I teach a course about it at UCSD in the fall. We don't have time to talk about it today. Um, in general, the marketing plan basically answers these questions. Where do we want to go? That's like that strategy, right? Where do we want? Position ourselves. You'll see what I mean by positioning before the end of today.
15:36
How do we get there? That's the tactics. Like, what are the products? How? How do we talk to people who do we talk to? How do we price this right? These are all tactics that are. That are levers that we can play with. How do we make sure we're there?
15:50
It's sort of is the measurement and and feedback from the market. And then, how do we sustain our position kind of. What's the strategy for the next move, right? Because you can think about. The market as a chess game, right? You, you make a move your opponent is going to make a move also, right?
16:04
Your competitors are not going to see that and say, oh, they're stealing our Market. Great, right? They're going to try to do something else, so you have to think strategically and a few steps ahead, but that's kind of in general. What the, what the process is like, and marketing plan done well will cover all of these kind of, uh, questions.
16:23
Feel free to stop if you have any questions by the way so. We talked about customer needs, and and we talked about definition. So, just to reiterate? Customer needs are. Anything that is, math creates value. Right, we don't have to be more philosophical than this. This is a really easy to work with definition.
16:44
We need to do stuff that brings value. If we do this, we satisfy needs, therefore needs. What's being myth? About customer awareness and expectations that someone mentioned before. You know, if I go with when my daughter was young, I would go with her to the storages. He would pull my shirt and say I need this toy.
17:06
Is it true? Did she needs this story based on this destination? Or that you want this toy? It's an issue question to ask, um, yeah, one I think is true. What what you needed was novelty entertainment, right? Those are the needs. And there are many things that can can meet those needs.
17:29
Maybe she needed that story in particular, but that's that's not what you meant when she said it. But that is. Your customer. Might have once. Once we came to think of our as needs, that that I set goals to to obtain right. I have once. I, I might need a new laptop to do my work.
17:51
But I don't know which which laptop. So I want to buy a little specific or like, but I might find information and for my friends or offerings, figure out which laptop to buy. Um. But, but my need is, is the work to be done. And maybe if someone says you don't need a laptop, I'll put a desktop in a cloud service and you can whatever.
18:14
Or you can just stop on your phone, then then the need to be next to other needs. Is going to begin to stay in a second. So, it's not about being basic or not. It's about. Like, your customers might have needs. They're not even aware of it. Give you an example, you're?
18:36
Well, you have to remember Sony Walkman. Right. Sony Walkman was a product. People didn't think they needed. And what is the need with a Sony Walker? What's being made?
18:55
Entertainment. Entertainment. Mobile mobile entertainment, exactly right. Mobile entertainment before Sony Walkman. There were some people that used to walk through the big boombox. Most people didn't want to do that. To the CEO of Sony, despite everybody else in the company. Decided. Here is inside the inside that. People have this need for mobile entertainment, and they would appreciate it.
19:27
Right, so? Once people saw that? And so other people enjoy me. They were like. I can do a value from this. Right, and I'm willing to pay for it. There are a lot of examples where both categories were started. Like that, I'll give you an example from nearby company across the across the street, named a device that replaced lab preparation.
19:55
The two, three post stocks. Five days and the device did it in four hours with one person working and only one consumable. These postdocs in the lab. They didn't work around saying, ooh, we need a device that does this work, because that's what they were talking about. They were talking about this work.
20:14
But once you've shown him these, like, they're like, wow, this is valuable. By the way, it was way more valuable to bend into the pi that hired them because the pi didn't spend the work themselves. All right, so the process of actually willing to pay more for this device and API is because API is low high process.
20:33
So, um?
20:38
No, not only they're equal, they're clearly hierarchical needs. Usually you, unless you're you know your. That's why Maslow's pyramid is where it is, unless your survival needs are meant to the list. You're going to be less worried about. Your social needs and status. Right. So there is a hierarchy.
20:57
Um, but I'm not right now. We just need to remember that. Needs are anything? If net creates value, that's really the useful thing. Because when we do our research, that's what we need to find out.
21:16
Um. Yes, AI tools, right? Yeah, so, so a lot, a lot of Technologies are like that you walk around, and you didn't think you needed this, but on the other hand, a lot of startups are coming up with stuff that that they think we need when we don't. So, I'll give an example.
21:36
You remember the company Tivo? Hebo, they were the first digital video recorder. Uh, bvr setup box, and they had a reference engine and a recorded stuff for you and stuff. I, even if you weren't there, and the founders of Tebow thought that the value of Tebow was design your own network.
22:05
All it was hardly anybody. Wanted to design their own network. They didn't walk around, saying, oh, I wish I. I designed the TV network. Right, they just didn't. But if you show, if you, if you went to sports fans, which is, there's kind of later generation, you're into sports fan, and said, never miss a game.
22:24
No, I like that, right? That value that talks to me if you were too busy. People, it's like, don't worry. Your show is being recorded. If you're stuck in a traffic jam or whatever, I can understand that so. Lots of interesting Dynamics about. Which particular needs are being met, and how do you communicate about the processes?
22:44
Some people like to think of needs as problems, and there are Frameworks called kind of. What's the job to be done? By the product. I think that's too restrictive. I like the language I'm using here, but if that helps you, you think about? Problems, and if customers don't realize they have a need, they don't realize they have a problem.
23:07
I don't have a problem. I the fact that you could improve their lives by creating more values still exists. Okay, just as an example. What's this product? Anybody? That's right. Is it milk? No.
23:38
Yeah, this is this is in particular. This is the unsweetened. Regional Alden, Greece. There's also Silcanada trying to promote any particular brand. Um. All the same? Why? So, this is an Outlook beverage, right here. You, you crush albums, you mix them with water, and you get this beverage. Why?
24:02
Why do we call it milk?
24:12
And got that out that it was, no, I'm not sure. But yeah, so, so this is mostly true. They see them, but they didn't succeed.
24:31
Automobile has existed for a very long time. In fact, there are some evidence that the biblical times people drink establish. Exploded as a category if someone had the great insight to say. Since this is kind of competing with India.
25:00
In the refrigerator. Such that it's obvious concerns that is substitute for milk. Sales Skyward. Do you actually need to keep it in the refrigerator at the same unique milk? The answer is no. Before that. Send packages. You'll be on the Shelf where I don't know. Uh, piece of crackers, but somewhere.
25:32
And this could last month, right? The expiration database is still free money. And it's kind of. Uber, conservative as it is. But you take this this same product and you position it. Is the milk substitute and suddenly you have a huge Market? Right. It's not the dream for no minutes.
25:57
It's one degree. Only beautiful people who are elected building tolerance. This is a vegetarian substitute for milk. And sell the other one. Look at the oats there.
26:13
How you put it. Even the store communicates customer and it satisfies what might satisfy different needs. What positioning is?
26:47
You want this, you need to refrigerate the ones you need less so, but? In general. It's not like milk that it goes down and refrigerated. Yeah, anyway. So, this is, this is just an example to give you another example. In a second.
27:31
Everything in marketing should be customer sensual because it always based on creating value to customers right. You don't create jobs with customers, the companies. You probably would.
27:45
And give you an example. Here are two sets of. Vegetarian offerings. One top, a garden burger, the original turkey turkey burger. And on the bottom, you have impossible and Beyond. Like, you agree with me that they're all kind of. Similar. Or is targeted by?
28:19
That is, napkins only. Experience. Who is targeted by the bottom ones? Everyone who eats hamburgers. And especially.
28:38
Right, they they add. The name of the purple youth vegetable, I forgot. Beats. Yeah, they had babies. So, so this, so this looks. More like Regional needs. Right, and and they worked for years, so the texture is closed and stuff like that. This is a meat substitute for meat eaters.
29:06
As opposed to the one on topics for vegetarians. And then you can see. You can just see, obviously, right. Who is your target of customer is very different? That's why the potential target market potential kind of market capital. These companies that that make meat substitutes for me. There's a much larger.
29:26
Are you think about where investors they're going to put their money? Well, there's a much higher potential for the bottom ones to reach a huge Market.
29:38
Yeah, okay, so? First, question who's your target customer really important to find out? And it could be an empirical question? Uh, given your target market. What are their needs and values and notice that needs could be, as we mentioned this, but I'll just characterize, and it could be functional or symbolic.
29:57
As I said. The part would be a transportation device. It could also be a signal to others and to yourself if you want the real, like one of the quintessential examples is SUVs. You've asked if I ask people in a class like, what is your fees? Like, why did you buy an AC?
30:18
Most people say you want to write Bounty goodness. If you're like, what's good about an SUV?
30:30
It's spacious. Um. Large storage exercise. Space. Four-Wheel drive. Space space. I kind of high view. Yeah, so for 99 of this stuff, minivan is better. Much better. Larger, safer, cheaper. Benefits better, and the percentage of people just empirically. The Senate of people who take their SUV off-road really off-road, where no normal car can drive.
31:11
It's less than one percent. So, for everything functional. Practically. And minivan is better. So why don't people drive the minivans because symbolically many of that is associated with like a soccer parent? Right. That's, like, that's, like, uh, whatever, whereas an SUV. Gives you the Allure that you put driving the Sahara Desert, right?
31:41
You could cross rivers and reach cliffs and whatever.
31:51
Um. And in the morning, we can argue, but I think I think I think this. This exam goes through same through sports cars, right, 1900 of people that drive sports cars don't get to drive faster than you drive your Prius on the tire. It's, it's it. These products deliver symbolic benefits.
32:13
I'm not saying these benefits are not real, by the way, they're very real. They have to remember that. It's like, I want to work with UCSD because UCSD is like the best in. I don't know cognitive science or biology or whatever. So, I want my company to for UCC to use my product because that's that's a symbol for the rest of the market, right?
32:33
So, so symbolic needs are real. We have to remember that my Engineers will focus on functional means. And he sounds like you think about. Ibuprofen versus Advil at CVS. Right. The compound is the same. But Advil is much more expensive. How can actually be more expensive? Well, people don't think they're the same.
32:58
From people's perspective. From the consumer perspective, they are not the same. Yeah, we'll talk about branding in Wednesday, but yes, it has to be with that as well. But that's the that's, you know, the value you create to customers is based on what customers receive? And that's really kind of the bottom line.
33:18
Okay, you talk about the fact that customers are heterogeneous and? Different customers could be more or less attractive than you talk about that. That's pretty obvious. How do I know this competition? Suppose I had some idea for something. How do I know who is my competition?
33:45
Someone who sells zero products. Okay.
33:54
Greg's answer is really the Nailed it on the head. Look at who else is meeting the same means? I swear I didn't show him the slides before. Nice jobs. People might say, oh, I look at who and who sells the same thing. A common answer, by the way, is Google or chat GPT, like Google or cpd, might might look at who's in the same category, but as we said, if the need is entertainment.
34:21
Like, if I want to see, I'm I will cook for kids like an interactive book for kids. Who is my competitor? Well, the playground is my, maybe my competitor or friends with a soccer ball could be my computer. Right. It's not the same, but it meets the same name.
34:37
Okay, so that's that's important to remember. Many people don't. And then, when I analyze competition, I have to think about what are the relative advantages and disadvantage in meeting the needs? Okay, that's how differential value is created. And when I look at my own company, I have to actually be honest and say, what are my core competencies or my capabilities?
34:59
What gives me the right to think I can create value here, and it could be my my science. It could be my technology. It could be my people. It could be my connections. It could be a combination of things it could be having access to people like that or technology connection.
35:17
Whatever it is, I can bring to the table. Um, equipment that I already have this kind of sales Network, right, and I can get to Physicians easily because I have, like all the relationships with it. Anything that helps me create value can be an advantage here. Okay, so. Department.
35:38
The bottom line is actually. Deeper or simpler than you than you think, but there's really only. Two ways to make it in business? Really, only two. The combination is maybe a third, but whatever is two ways, you either make it. You know, you make it in business by creating value.
35:58
Then, you either make something better. Or make something cheaper. Right, because you're either creating more value at the same price where you're creating less value with a lower price. So people get left with more money. And these are the two ways to make it in business. Whoever tells you otherwise?
36:21
He's selling some things he's lying or doesn't understand if somebody says, boy, if it's a great idea for a startup, um. Listen, what do you think about this and then and then you listen to this and they're not doing something better or cheaper? Then you should say, uh, I'm not trying to work.
36:37
Yes, hands up. Hi, uh, yes, can you hear me all right? Yeah. Wonderful, um, great lecture. So far, just a question about this kind of a few minutes ago you were talking about, you know, sometimes a customer might not even realize they have a need or something like that.
36:55
I guess you know, a product like that, um, I'm already kind of forgetting, like the Sony Walkman, was the example you used on that. Does that creating more value, or is that lower price? How would you? How would that kind of fit into this? When you have? So, it's creating more value, right?
37:15
Because you're creating a product that didn't exist before. So, I had like 80 value. And because I bought your product. I'm 90 value because there's nothing this. When you launch a really new product, that's what it's called, really new product. Then you know we needed competitors. Right, you're creating more value.
37:32
And that's why Sony could also command a nice price point for that value, because there's not an easy competitor. Okay. Great question so! We analyze this. I like to think of it as a three column table very high technology. Um, I think the customer needs in the middle. I put my capabilities, and here I would just abstract stuff, so you'll see how it works.
37:56
My cubic built it on the left competitions on the right. If there are several competitors, I'll put all of them there. And then, all I do is draw arrows. Kind of how to make his abilities help to create value for different needs. Okay, sometimes I create a lot of value.
38:13
I just think of arrows here. In this example, this will just help you visualize this. And then customers could be from different segments. So, let's say, blue segment is California yellow segment is Texas? Um, yeah. Um, I'm keeping terminology at kind of a limited so. So, this is kind of.
38:37
Let's say, this is what we're talking about. When you analyze customers, we realize customers in California. I had needs one to three customers in Texas, as in three and four. We do what you see on the left creation, just you see on the right, and then I should ask you like.
38:52
Well. Who should be targeted? Should we target people in California? Should we Target people in Texas? Blue segment or yellow segment?
39:08
Yellow is where you have a capability that your competition doesn't.
39:16
But, but competition is strong only three, right? So, I didn't provide enough information. We don't know the hierarchy of these needs as you talked about, and we don't know the exact degrees of chips and just showing that these are strategic questions, right. Who should we target? If we target yellow, it's obvious what we're going to say, right, like everybody does.
39:34
Maybe we're the only ones that do need for web. And if you target blue segment, we'll say, you know, yes, you know? Everybody targets need three, but really, we're the only ones that Target anyone. Maybe you need money is not enough, right? Maybe we say, as a company, we need to acquire the ability to address any two if we want to answer if we want to address him a second before right, these are the strategic questions you can have from a value proposition.
40:02
And again, this helps visualize the analysis we talked about before. But it also implies. When I said, what are we going to say? That, in fact, is our position. Right. This is how we say what we do relative to others. What we want to be known for in the eyes of the customer relative to others to regarding yellow.
40:27
We want to be known for addressing it all. And we can do it for because we're experiencing whatever Z is. And and others are not. Does it make sense? Easy way to do it, give you some practice in a second. Wait, sorry. I have a quick question. So, because?
40:49
You're addressing me for solely based on the experience I'm seeing. But if you target blue, you also have, like, it's more spread out outweighing, like the fact that competition has only. A strengthen me three, but if you two need one, then you can say you have experience like, I'm just following the answer.
41:08
I didn't say, just Target yellow segment. I said, yeah, decision. It could be the neat one is the most important right encryption that I ordered them based on priority. And we should definitely do need one right. We should definitely go for California first. Because that's the most important thing.
41:26
I see, right? I'm just, I'm just showing you that if you, if you. Kind of populate the table, like this, and draw some arrows. You suddenly have what the chess board looks like. And here's what they're doing. I could expect them to do something you know the next turn.
41:43
Here's what I'm doing. Here's why I'm strong. Here's where I'm weak, right? Some some of you may have seen a SWOT analysis in business strength, opportunity, strength, weaknesses, opportunity spreads. I can easily derive where my strength are where my opportunities are, where my weaknesses are, and what are the threats from from this analysis.
42:02
Uh, we have a handout, yes.
50:50
Marketing in between. There's chopping the market into this discrete pieces. For various reasons. So, why would we segment? Earth is some segments have a higher value for what we're doing, which basically enhance the fate between the firm strength and customer needs. This could be horizontal based on the case, right?
51:13
Blue cars, red car one, is not better than the other, but maybe of interest to different people, right? That's case-based differentiation. Makes very high-end computers, which are expensive, very cheap computers, which are not expensive because some people are kind of a cheap computer. They don't pay for quality. They're not using others really need the quality.
51:39
Yeah, we'll talk about The Branding. We'll guess later. Apple is gone. Yeah, clearly have horizontal too. Tesla actually took the Apple Playbook and applied it to cars. You really want to think about it in Silicon Valley, um, we also might segment to enhance the peak with our current product line, right?
51:59
We have products that address. I don't know Gamers, and now we want to. We want to Target, uh, people who work at the desk job and you.
52:13
Think about personal computers. Dale and HP both make personal computers, which are inside, probably almost identical. Right, but Dale says, really, it's you know on-site 24 hours warranty? And HP Center will design the computer. Is covering everything so that you be proud when they get in your living room as an accessory.
52:43
Right, so they're targeting own use and office use with very similar products. But now, because? The people going with, like, an ugly Dell at home. People like Homer and have to see the prices of them right. You do competitive pressure to differentiate, uh, sometimes it's easy to enhance the communication process, right?
53:04
Instead of electric scooters or students like scooters or not something different populations, but I know where the students are, I can Target them. I know how to speak your language and communicate, so maybe I'll talk to some students. For people. Some segments are growing. Some segments are shrinking. Some segments can pay more.
53:26
Some segments don't.
53:33
Um, agree about people and also not thought about many times. I will segments because of research limitations. I think my product to Target the entire nation. Don't have to watch it. To really do a Super Bowl. I don't have the budgets to Target everywhere, so I'll start with some local geographies.
53:56
And get budgets, or maybe in a large company kind of make a proof of concept. To see this show company that it's working, so they're really invest in extending the sport and the budget so we can Target other markets, right? So, we sometimes segment purely based on race implementations, uh, that this always happens when we already kind of a young, small company.
54:19
And again, segmentation is a tool to simplify your life. It's basically like taking a big problem and chopping it to smaller pieces. If you don't need to don't, right? But it's, but it's kind of it's there. And it usually helps simplify the world. Um, often, by the way, I get this kind of chicken and egg problem with startups.
54:40
You know, if we have some Network products, and then we start Skype if you're the first person that bought Skype. He was zero value. Zero value. You couldn't communicate with anybody. Right, the more people you have Skype, the more people you can communicate with exactly start somewhere. So, I'm going to segment in order to start with the people who just get Skyped because it's cool, like the innovators, techies, whatever you want to call them.
55:06
They're usually the segment that gets a lot more about a product because of, you know, it satisfies more of their needs. And I need to start there. So oftentimes, we'll do that. And there are many ways to segment. Behavioral demographics. Psychographics are kind of the most common. Um, I'll show you the difference between demographics and psychographics.
55:31
This guy has a rainy MBA works in Wall Street makes 200, 000 a year. Bonuses get started. Is in his late 20s, and this is how he likes to spend his vacations. This guy is another Brady. MBA graduate works at Wall Street makes 200, 000 plus bonuses. Um is in his late 20s, and this is how we like to spend his vacation.
55:58
Right, this year is so, so demographically, they're identical. Right, but psychographically, they might be very different, right? Their risk tolerance, for example, might be very different. So, demographics are observable characteristics. Think about sends this. Think about things like that psychographics are things we need to actually research the finder.
56:22
Here is the result. One example of some psychographic research. Market research company did? Um, the market open, like DNA sequencing, and as you can see, I don't have to read to you. They look at various. Roles within DNA sequencing organizations, and they look at what the motivational drivers are, how much influence they have to purchase this agent.
56:47
What's their decision-making style? What's the influence in the budget and given some, you know, whatever? They also looked at what other brands they use as if it's going to Signal something, right? So this kind of this kind of analysis you can't get anywhere unless you? I miss. Interview survey and other ways to get this and psychographics are.
57:13
Um. Someone asks, are examples of large companies who don't practice segmentation and differentiation in their marketing? The answer is is kind of, no. But if you think about the main Uber search page? Which is just Google and a kind of search field. That's one example, where that's supposed to be across the board of everyone.
57:38
They don't run any advertising on that page whatsoever, right? It's the old property, the only page in the internet without advertising nowadays, so they can. They basically appeal to everybody in the same way, so segmentation could also come at different levels once you search yourself. The initial value you get from Google is no segmentation.
58:03
Um. And, you know, again, this is market research. I'm just, I'm just showing you an example of one result of psychographic researchers, so you'll get a sense of what what people might care about. My guess is they, they did. Based on some commission, they got somebody dated to do it, and they that somebody decided they were interested in that.
58:24
You know, I'm not saying this is this is right or whatever. Just show you your examples. Um. In the last minute. Um. You know what? I'll stop here. We'll continue here on Wednesday 5, 31, after today. Wait, we have until six, right? That is correct. We have until six.
58:45
Yeah, sorry. I just, I was okay. I thought I stand in white, um, okay. So.
58:55
As I said, positioning is a combination segmentation instantiation. We have to kind of select, which, you know, who we're targeting, so differentiation. The most important part. As I said before, will the customer perceive our product to be different? All right, if we? Uh, come up with with, you know?
59:15
I don't know. Ibuprofen. And there's Advocate out there. Will the customer perceive us to be different? If we come up with kind of another electric vehicle? What's going to make it different in the isocles? And think about Vivian. What did rivianne do to be different from Tesla?
59:43
Suv structs. Right? So, they said, okay, the technology is kind of the same, right, and Tesla actually made older patents available, so they're using Tesla technology in some parts. But they said, what is Tesla not doing? And at the time as the SUVs or trucks. Now, Tesla has you can argue as a drug.
01:00:09
Everybody has opinions about the cyber trust, whatever, but but really, and said, no, no, we're going to do, is, we know, people who have SUVs? We've seen it before because you know they, they can't see us over minivans. And there's uses for that. So, we're going to go this way, right?
01:00:23
They had to differentiate otherwise more of the same. There'll be second mover. With current the same. That's not a good, valuable position, right? It wouldn't better than succeeding.
01:00:39
And then we say, okay, how do we translate the benefits the customer needs to product attributes? Um, how do we identify pressure competitors? We talked about doing better or cheap. What we're talking about this is just reminding you Brian will talk about Wednesday, and I'm going to focus on that okay.
01:00:56
What I'm going to show you now is is a really interesting tool called perceptual maps, and you'll see why this is helpful. Exceptual maps are exactly what they are. We ask people about their perceptions, so this is abstract again after we've done our period, too. But we can think about it as think about it as.
01:01:13
Rising wallet. Okay, let's. Let's assume attribute one is, is the horizontal one is quality and attribute to its price? Okay? So, we ask people. How much water do you need? Right, and they say, oh, I want another body. I want very little quality. I want something in between. We also ask people how much are you willing to pay for quality in this category?
01:01:38
Some people were independence. Some people are not going to pay a lot whatever, and then I basically plot the results here. I collapse them in segments, so segment three meets low quality results. I'm not willing to pay. Segment four is willing to pay a lot for high quality. Segment two is someone between segment one is kind of crazy.
01:01:59
They're willing to pay a lot for nurple. I don't know, you know, we could rename these attributes. You'll find the logic, but it's just it's just an example, right? This is a really easy market research for you. Because we base our outputs, a slide out the door, just because some of the slides answered the question before.
01:02:18
I'll give you all this idea, um, good question. Sorry, I forgot to say so. This is really easy. I say, you know, how much 40 how much you will have to pay easy to ask people? There's no reason for them not to tell me what they think and I can plot this on the ground.
01:02:31
I can also do a similar exercise and say. We had four products on the market. How much quality do you think this product has? Or, how expensive do you think this product is? Right again. Easy questions to ask people. An in this typical example, people tell me that products being poor are kind of high quality and expensive.
01:02:54
Product 2 is kind of mid-range. Product one is high quality, but is less expensive. Like, based on how I rename the answer. So these are. These are all simple, whatever the nice part is. If I take these two slides and copy, paste them on each other, which I call PowerPoint magic.
01:03:13
I get this graph. In this graph. I argue, is the chess match of this market? Like, this is the playing field. But it's not only the playing field. This is not the playing field from an engineer perspective who makes these products. This is the playing field from the perspective of customers.
01:03:37
Customers perceive product three and four. To be high-end and expensive. It could be that product 4 is actually higher quality than product three. Or or more, whatever. But customers don't see it that way. Yeah, yeah, we'll talk about this in a second. So, this, this is the fact that what's in the market now, right?
01:04:00
This is what customer told me. Now, I can start asking strategic questions, someone asked. Why isn't there a product for segment three? Where it could be this, you know, it's actually not profitable to manufacture. Product. So cheap that that segment three would buy it. It's possible that secret three is too small or not interesting, right?
01:04:27
I'm not, you know, I haven't provided, you can have lots of information. I kept this very abstract. But these questions, like, where do you put yourself on a perceptual map? Is positioning, right, because where you put yourself on a position on a perceptual map is, how do you want customers to view your product?
01:04:46
Relative to others in the market. Does that make sense? But by asking two simple questions of customers, I can now ask strategic questions of positioning.
01:05:02
Yeah, it's exactly what CEOs are. So, see where you pitch this when you pitch two VCS. They're all trying to imagine this if if you pass the stage to get due diligence, they might go out and do this market research. Right, but it. At first, everybody's guessing this. And this.
01:05:20
This way, I just showed you with two perceptual maps I can actually. Do this empirically and scientifically. Right. These segments are the result of clustering algorithms. And and so forth, right? So? Now, what does it mean that products three and four are closer? On this perceptual map in product three in one.
01:06:00
Yeah, so all three answers. Are exactly on point. Distance on a perceptual map is exactly differentiation, because remember, this is from the eyes of the customer. If customers see two products is close. That means they're more directly competing with each other, because for customers, they're the same. See if one of them is going to be more expensive.
01:06:24
Everybody's going to flock to the other barring brand loyalty and stuff like that. Whereas product three and one are really not related in the eyes of the customers program raises its price. It's not going to affect product resales at all. Right. So, these terms of the perceptual map is differentiated so I can ask myself, how is my product doing?
01:06:47
When am I positioned the way I I'm? I, I hope that, as you know, the way, my strategy strategy suggested, and I can also say, I'm going to come into this Market. What are the implications of targeting segment four? Like, who am I competing with? What are the implications of targeting segment 3?
01:07:09
So? Yeah, so this is, you know this, this, you know this? I, I kept it abstract enough, but this is used across the board. Successful companies, really successful companies. Do this in one way or another all the time. Okay, you know exactly how they're differentiated or not differentiated, or more or less relative to others.
01:07:30
And they also think about if I, if I introduce this next generation of my product, what does it mean? For example. Starbucks used to be really differentiated as the high-end coffee. Right, Dunkin Donuts started making coffee. That again was accessible to people. And it's not that Starbucks was moved down, but Dunkin Donuts moved up.
01:07:57
So, Starbucks started feeling price pressure. Because because now there's there's.
01:14:58
Is the current or company and the way they wrote it is for business people who rent cars. ABC is the company will give you the best service among all currental companies because the employees own the company. Just countries if he sits down and says, hurt is our biggest competitor at the time.
01:15:20
We are. We are renting kind of parliament cars. We're renting kind of in the same locations, right? So if you look at capabilities, we have the same capabilities. However, we have employee ownership incentives. Doesn't. Okay. That might mean that our employees will put in greater effort because they care more about the success of the company.
01:15:44
So we can. We can among the needs our service. Right? Maybe not the first need. But that that's that creates value. So we'll argue that we create the best service and work to deliver that. Who cares most about service? Oh, it's the people who rent cars most often. Historians call once every two years.
01:16:06
Yeah, you know, lousy service experience, you know? So, what, but if you rent car weekly? So those are the business people, but it also helps with the business. People are the least price sensitive. Right? So that's, that's the more lucrative segment than it's growing. So, we'll focus on being.
01:16:23
We'll rent cars to everybody, and this is our Focus. This is our positioning. Work for rent, will focus on service, more business people, rent cars, and will emphasize internally that our employee ownership means that we need to provide better service. And we're competing with all car rental companies. So they launched this internally.
01:16:41
They show this to ad agencies that now create ads for Avis and the ads focus on service because the employees care and they hire new managers, they follow. This is what we're about. We're focusing, right? This is the strategy. And it works really well. Turns out, like three, four years later, Enterprise comes in, and for whatever reason provides better service.
01:17:06
Because they're the ones that start picking you up from home or from whatever or dropping you off. And so consumer Report says that if its customers rate Enterprises the best service? So, now ABC goes back to the drawing board. Well, this is not going to work anymore. We have to do something else.
01:17:22
Okay, so that's that's positions, but I wanted to show you one example of a positioning statement. Um, also. You have these slides. Um, this positioning statement you'll see has the same components this I got with permission from the guy at Johnson and Johnson walks around the 100 and something companies in Johnson Johnson.
01:17:44
It teaches them how to do marketing well. Is, this is the actual one used by Johnson and Johnson. You can see in Target group, they want their demographic psychographic, their condition, their attitudes, the current usage behaviors, their needs. These are all the same, and then reasons why. And then they add, like, because they use this directly to give to ad agencies.
01:18:06
What's the brand character? What's the narrative? Do we have any kind of celebrity magazine that we think are agreed to speak with this, right? It's a bit more elaborate. The four components I've shown you are here, and they're the heart of any positioning statement.
01:18:31
And to the question in the text. A niche is a segment. Right, it's exactly a segment. So, most of the time, when we start, we'll have our launch segment. Beat some version of a niche or not, and then we'll have a growth segment. Okay, and we can talk about that offline, but that's kind of.
01:18:50
Um. Okay, so just to summarize today. What we've done is, we've learned how to identify opportunities through the customer analysis and their needs that are valued by a distinct group of customers. That's by segmentation could be a niche. Could be not. And are a good fit with your capabilities.
01:19:14
But the less good fit with your competitors capabilities, right? That's positive differentiation. And that's why he said, if you read this, this is exactly what gives you the right to exist. As a business entity, and as I said also, if. Trying to position yourself to find a job. This is exactly what you need to do.
01:19:35
Right, identify where, where is, is it that you can create more value than other job applicants to this company? Right? If you can communicate that, you have a better chance of winning the job. I'm not going to go there right now, but it's the same if you're looking for a romantic partner.
01:19:58
It. It really is which, which is kind of interesting, but it's basically it because this positioning process. Is at the heart of marketing. Right, and marketing is all about creating value.
01:20:17
Okay. That, is it for today? I can take questions about today, and if not, we'll continue applying this to branding on Wednesday. Thank you everyone you've been great!
01:20:37
Thank you. I have a question about the perceptual map yes. What did you was it? A question, like, you asked, what does distance between? What is distance on? Symbolize or correspond with yes?

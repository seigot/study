For me as a supervisor, others in the past. It was so helpful having. Some knowledge of EQ because? I, I didn't know how to talk to people and give them feedback without them completely falling apart. And, and then hating me afterwards, even when they say I want direct feedback.
00:19
Get a direct feedback, and I'm like, no, you did not. What director you wanted to be? Yeah, yeah, you want you want direct indirect. You want to direct American style. Yeah, now I love this conversation already. You know, we're here a few minutes earlier. That's why we started opening, you know, the conversation because a lot of people probably just watched the video, you know, it's a.
00:37
It's a very rich content video and the suit just told us such a beautiful story. She got a time to reflect, you know, right after she retired from FedEx, so thought it was just a beautiful moment to catch up with everyone and a few things in Melanie. And, uh, that, uh, did I?
00:54
How do I pronounce your name, uh? Well, both of you shared. Some of the reflection is going to come out throughout the next 90 minutes as well, so. I think you just warmed up the room. Thank you. Okay, so I am going to get things started because people is going to gradually join us and we have very limited time.
01:20
90 minutes is very short, as you probably all noticed that and. I'm just going to get things started. Okay, everyone hear me. Okay, I suppose, because we just had him. Yeah, okay, oh good, all right. Okay. Any interest in my screen here? Okay, hello, everybody! Welcome, I'm really glad to be part of with, you know, to be with you tonight as part of this micro MBA program with UC San Diego over the night next to 90 minutes.
01:54
We will explore a topic that I care deeply. About meeting with emotional intelligence. And I've been teaching this course since 2018. But today, uh, so it will be just a small slice of what do we cover in the food MBA class? Um, so think of today's experience as a preview and hopefully.
02:18
Um, I will see some of you in my class in the near future. Every group. Whether you say a classroom like this, okay, we have what 158. The numbers keeps going up. Students join us. And then, whether it's a classroom, a virtual classroom, an in-person classroom, or a company, a team, or a community, right?
02:40
Every one of those group has Norms. So, I would like to, uh. Urge everyone's help to help me to create and learning culture for whatever the next 90 minutes. This group is going to experience together, so here comes our Norm. Um, so, first of all, with all of you here, I will focus on sharing prepared content.
03:05
Um, and I won't be able to monitor the chat. You probably also see an earlier slides. Um, because instead of multitasking, I think the best time for it of time, the best return investment for you will be. I focus on the content that I have already prepared for you.
03:22
Um, so, but chat can still be used. You know, during our q a later on, but also, if you have really urgent question that you wanted to ask, or if you want to support, technically, you can directly DM our director message, our supporting staff here. Um. Secondly, you still have plenty of chances to get engaged, and I want this.
03:46
I really curated this and want this to be highly interactive and engage the session so. There are live posts questions. Throw out the 90 minutes, so I would hope that all of you participate. Um, and then we are shared the result with the entire class. Uh, from my teaching experiences, a lot of questions that you may have in mind.
04:11
Oftentimes, that answer is showed up in my later lecture so. I would actually like to dedicate a q a session at the end. I will reserve about 20 30 minutes, and I would also stay 30 minutes longer after the session. In case you don't want to continue the conversation, it's optional you don't have to.
04:34
But if you like to stay, I'm more than welcome to do that. And lastly, is not only a learning culture. I always like to create a safe space for everyone, because when it comes to emotional intelligence. Everybody has their own perspective, their own experience. Yeah, people sometimes get vulnerable and emotional as well.
04:53
So, this is an opportunity. I invite you to practice Intel emotional intelligence by listening to each other. Uh, be respected about everybody's perspective and also openly share your thoughts with all of us. Okay, so that said, let's begin. Um, we were just chatting about this video that you watched before the class, and I captured this screenshot.
05:20
It's probably not a complete because the number keeps going up. And then, first of all, thanks for everyone. That who has participated this survey? Um, so I'd like to show you a snapshot, a sample big enough sample about 100 people here. Um, so which part of suspense story resonated most with you, right?
05:38
So, as we can, tell here about more than 40 people thinking was hearing the hard feedback. Uh, well, when Sue's right, good friend, the HR Director put her into a room telling her, hey, you have to change, you know, you don't know what you're talking about. You are at the risk.
05:58
Um. Of, you know, being not self-aware? I think you should. You chose a gross overego, so that was a beautiful moment. I mean, a lot of people are also thinking about the sharing her story, right, just as a whole, showing the vulnerability showing that the lesson that she learned.
06:14
I have to say that when I interview people, it's easy to talk about the things you know, great that achievement that you have accomplished, but it's really hard to open your heart and to tell people that actually. I have also made a mistake. You know, I have also learned lessons right from those mistakes that I made.
06:32
So, um, you know, I really think Sue did. Such a great job to open her story with us, so I really appreciate that. And then, of course, you know, other picking the marker was a beautiful moment, right? She stepped into leadership as well as, you know, to ask how someone else feel.
06:53
To demonstrate the empathy so? I think all of those is a part of our story. Um, which interesting is this happened a little?
07:10
Uh, you went on mute Helen. Okay, yeah, some something just happened. Can you hear me now? Okay, I don't know which part we cut off, but? Uh, but I wanted to come back to this slide was. Um, this interview was literally happened in my classroom last year when I taught the leading with emotional intelligence.
07:30
And a lot of those questions. I prepared, of course, sets of questions, but a lot of questions was asked by the students who were actually in the classroom with us. So, just imagine if you were in their classroom, what would you ask? How would you, you know? Feel like this.
07:48
This live interview happening right there that actually happens a lot with my classroom, because what happened with the screen? Where's that line coming from? Do you see that? Are you there? Yeah, Helen, that may just annotate feature. So, um. Oh, okay, maybe either you clicked on? But anyway, I don't.
08:19
Can you remove the line? I'm just gonna move forward. Yes, okay. Thank you. Okay, so the stat, that's the second survey question. The emotional intelligence is mostly. I've been watching, uh, you know, monitoring the result coming since yesterday. I think it's pretty consistent a majority of you, you know, more than 65 percent thinking that emotional intelligence is a leadership essential?
08:43
So, congratulations! I think all of you realized the connection between emotional intelligence and Leadership. I think it's such a. In some of those. One of the answer was, it's a superpower I want to develop. I think it's a it's also a super powerful leadership. Um, and the 20 of people voted say it's superpower.
09:04
So, um, I think it's just Illustrated the importance that we all realize that emotional intelligence. Takes in our. And then, oh, sorry. And then, this is a what color best represent emotional intelligence to you? Um, this is just a creative question, you know, there's really no another right or wrong answer, but it's very interesting for me because we have large enough sample sizes.
09:29
A lot of people voted green, which green usually is a color you know to represent gross, balanced, and emotional maturity, right? And a lot of you also voted as blue, so as served as calm, you know, an empathy agent and a self-regulation purple is wisdom, compassion, deep connection, and orange is warmth, openness, and emotional expression, um, so in a way.
09:57
If you're looking at the emotional intelligence and if you look at all of those color, it can do a lot for us. So, my takeaway from this is emotional. Intelligence is almost a rainbow color, right? It's more than just one color, and it depends to what situation you're in, and it might help you as a a different asset.
10:23
And now we are going to release poll question number one and two while I'm going through the agenda. So, we're gonna have five chapters to cover today. The first one, we're going to discuss, just explore why human-centered intelligence matters. Right and then, followed by? Um, the course design of an intelligent system.
10:46
Um, and then, uh, we will start with since we are only doing a slice of the course. So, I like to start with self leadership. Um, that gives you a preview of this course and how we begin the journey. And then, we're going to talk about building a house of intelligence and then finally will reserve some time for you to ask questions and share your thoughts and and, you know, make connections.
11:13
So, we started chapter one by asking a question why human-centered intelligence matters? So, give you a moment to thinking about, you know, some potential answer that might happen in your mind?
11:29
And. What I like to do is a quick reflection in terms of. Um, my experience, right? And, uh, I like to share a bit of the backstory and how I actually build a course and why I did what I did, and so this session is not only just about sharing my resume, which you know you could look it up easily on LinkedIn in anywhere, but I wanted to explain the why behind the creating the course and how it connects to where I come from and where I believe leadership needs to go.
12:06
So, first of all, I feel very fortunate to have spent the first half of my career working three Tech Giants. So, starting with Foxcow, the world's largest Electronics manufacturing and then Apple, where I was part of the original iPhone launch team and helped ship multiple generations of breakthrough products.
12:29
And then I later join a Google X, the moonshot Factory behind its self-driving cars. Now you know waymo is the company, and then Google Glass and many other Pioneer ideas. And uh, over those years, right. Working in Silicon Valley, I grow from an individual contributor to middle management. And eventually fast tracked into an executive law.
12:53
So? At Silicon Valley, it's high speed, high pressure, right. I had a realization that no one actually has all the answers, especially when you are flying the plane where you're trying to build it, build it. The second half of my career, a career led me to teaching and Advising.
13:13
So, after years of leading in industry, I was invited to help shape the curriculum at UC San Diego in 2017. And a year later, I transitioned from an advisor to a with a vision to an educator with a mission. The mission is really to elevate emotional intelligence in leadership.
13:35
And in 2022, I found Oceanside perspective, a startup non-profit focused on soft-scale education, and we are about to celebrate our 30 year birthday, and I invite you to join our community. So, why did I really build this course? So over the years. That people have told me, and I also have to come to a realization about my superpower.
14:02
Um, so, first of all, solving complex problems. Secondly, working with people and then designing a designing system that able to scale. So, this course actually bring all this together. Um, all my three, all my superpower together. Um, but isn't typical. Like, type A personality, right? I have also received a lot of feedback throughout the years to listen more to relax more, so believe it or not.
14:28
It also show up in this courses, right? So welcome to this journey, and we're going to build an emotional, intelligent, um. That's not just only personal, but also powerful and practical. So, now you know my story, right? I was a supply chain executive in a technology industry and what I learned from that position are those positions I actually was.
14:53
You know, I learned how to build products. I learned how to scale teams. I earned multiple promotions right from individual contributor to mid-level all the way to the executive level. Then, so those leadership opportunity for me that I come to realization that the learning is navigating. I able to navigate a certainty that how to build a trust and also work across culture, especially supply chair, because we talk about talking about global supply chain.
15:26
Many different organization countries industry working together. And then, when I become an educator, right, and also a founder for my own non-star, a non-profit startup that I shifted my focus to human-centered education in the soft skills? So those are sort of my learnings from each of my, you know, I?
15:47
We all wear different hats, so you know from different rows that I play, but what are some of the insights that really? Uh, joke to this class. So, first of all, um. When I was at the supply chain professional, right, I realized quickly. The technical skill got me started, therefore, that I'm able to join Foxconn, then Apple and Google.
16:14
But that's not enough. When you're taking a more leadership position, right? So, people skill matters more. But even that has a limitation. And finally, I think emotional intelligence is the missing piece in leadership because it goes so much more deeper than just people skill. Show you some examples later.
16:38
So, my reflection? Um, and the reason that I built this course because there is clearly from my leadership journey. I learned there's a shifter from IQ to EQ. Become more senior. In the leadership. So, I invited you to take a few moments just to reflect. My journey has shaped not just my career, but also this course.
17:07
Where do you see yourself along this leadership Journey? Are you more working with product these days? Working with people? And do you feel like you have enough people skill? What about the emotional intelligence? Does that have a? To play.
17:33
So, I also got a question right. Whether being an educator or being a leader in the industry is, people ask me because people wanted to learn he wanted to quote, right? So what skill to learn? So, the best way for me to answer this question is categorize in terms of the skills that we it takes for us to be successful.
17:51
So, first of all, there's a category hard scales, right. Hard scales are. Utilize our logical Center, its objective, and oftentimes we call IQ. Examples will be like writing skills, math skills, you know, Financial modeling language, or are you like a subject matter expert? Are you a programmer, right? So, that's a hard skill category.
18:16
On the other hand, is soft skills. Soft skills are subjective. Oftentimes utilize our emotional Center and people name them EQ in general, right? So, those are including, like, interpersonal skills, leadership, teamwork, creativity, curiosity, and problem solving. What's interesting about it is hard skill. It's a relatively easy to measure because you're able to take an exam, write a test to say, well, I got an A in math.
18:45
Therefore, I mastered it, you know, you're able to show that certificate or test or GPA, right? So people say, well, I'm good at that, right? However, on the other hand, on the soft skill side, it's very difficult. I'm gonna say, well, I'm very emotional, intelligent household. How do you prove that?
19:02
What have you done, right? So you realize those differences, but in any position, uh, you know, I would say that you need both, right? You need a both the hard skills, and you also need a soft skills. So, here's my 2x2 easy framework to guide people to focus whatever you.
19:24
About to learn about, acquire, and how do you prioritize that what to prioritize? So, if you work with more with people, or do you actually work more with products, right? If you're looking at yourself right now in the next award of 535 10 years? What are you going to work with more?
19:43
So if you're working more with product, I would say, well, there's plenty of things you could refresh yourself for hard skills, right, whether that being AI or being something else. So, I think, yeah, you do need to enhance your hard skills. If product is your priority, however, if you work more with people, I think, check your inventory about soft skills.
20:07
Right. Is that an area for improvement? Is that an area for growth? Um, so I think you would know the answer because everybody's situation is very different, but this served as sort of a general guideline for you to think through it. So, assuming right, you have. Um, you know, IQ.
20:27
I mean, we all have certain level, whether that's degree that's something we learned experience. The IQ were actually enhance your working memory. As well as your working capacity, it will also give you a lot of ability right to take out different type of job. And then. Also, we all have certain level of emotional intelligence, for sure, right?
20:49
There's a lot of benefits of EQ here is, for example, I think we all need you know this as a buffer to stress and anxiety, right? So, when I get stressed out, I think that's what I fall back is, like, okay, where can I do? What can I do, you know, to?
21:07
Um, to tabbing to my emotional intelligence as a as an asset, and then, um, one thing was very interesting, is, you know, when people, when you say, well, this, uh, more entrepreneur real mindset, it actually has demonstrated a lot emotional intelligence because entrepreneur real mindset. It really means that I'm not happy with my status as well.
21:28
I want to make changes. I want to make impact. So when you want to make a change is where you want to make impact you, you need to bring other people along so it challenges a lot. Actually, your emotional intelligence and and the skills interpersonal skills is soft skill, of course.
21:45
As part of the emotional intelligence? Um, but in between right, this ieq and EQ? So, what is connecting and amplifying both is actually curiosity? So this article from hbr? Title is curiosity as important as intelligence. I actually like to think curiosity as our best friends, and I tell you why, because curiosity not only introduce growth.
22:15
Um, and not just as a tool, but it's also a mindset, right. What does curiosity give it to you? It gives you a hungry mind for learning and acquiring knowledge. It gives you an open mind to different perspectives. And it also gave you a tolerance right to for ambiguity, which by the way is essential for leadership.
22:37
So, when you're stuck or in certain? Curiosity actually gets you moving. So why we will see? It's your best friend, right? Because as children, we all had it. Remember the time you yourself or even your children that keep asking why all the time? Right. We love those wives because it comes from, uh, you know, children.
23:04
We think that's cute. That's very smart. However, along the way, right when we grow up. So, whether it's tests, whether it's grades, whether it's promotion, whether it's a negotiation contract you have to sign, we stopped asking. Wise, right? Because people expect you have answers, not just questions. So, I like to show the slides because I wanted to remind you that bring your best friend.
23:37
To learn and let curiosity guide you how you learn. How do you lead and how you grow?
23:48
Yes, Patrick.
23:53
Uh, hello, thank you, uh, great love extra so far. I was just curious, I know. In the poll, you provided us. You asked whether we thought? Um, EQ could be. Uh, gamedor, uh, learned skill, and I'm sure you're gonna get to that in a minute. But I also kind of have the same question with curiosity.
24:16
Um, you know, I know, you said, as a kid, we're more Curious than adults. But, um, you know, I work as in a science in science, so I feel like a and I'm a researcher. So very important. My job, important part of my job is to be curious, so I'm curious are there people who can learn to be more Curious, or is that kind of a personality trait or things like that?
24:35
Yeah, uh, we talk about it in the course in terms of, you know. I oftentimes remind people to bring your best friend, but I like this analogy because you know, every time, we even have a common language in the class. It's like, did you bring your friend? You know, it was just a.
24:50
Just like, weakening moment is, like, oh, light bulb, I was, like, yeah, why not? I'm there's anymore, I'm asking more, you know? I let me learn from others. Um, so there's a way to practice that. Absolutely. We also have those intellectual Journal that you have to enter, and there are questions related to curiosity, and there's multiple module.
25:12
Um, it's connected to curiosity as well, but it is something in the background, uh, it's not a standard alone manager, but it's something the background will remind and practice all the time. Excellent question! Thank you! Okay, so that was my idea or thoughts, right? Sort of, you know, after working for the industry and after become an educator, however.
25:34
I'm going to show you. The numbers, and you tell me what happened after that. So 11. 30, 22. And if you make them in a date November 30, 2022. So many of you probably thought about it is. That's where Charles GBT was launched. Everything seems changed after that, right?
25:58
Because that's where the AI really enter into our daily life. I mean in the past. If you talk about machine intelligence, artificial intelligence is still a little far away from us, but GBT changed everything. So, then, now, everywhere you go, there's a charge BT, right? It's in the elephant in the room.
26:16
So, there's a big question. What skills do we learn? Do we need in an AI driven world?
26:29
So, I thought about that as well. So, I've been doing some research and trying to find, you know, some good sources right to share with. Share with you. So I found this the water economic Forum actually has this report future of job reports, leaving published couple years I and IB monitoring that?
26:49
Um sources. And uh, so what it this first of trap show to you is a core scales in 2025? Remember this hard scale of soft skill that we talked about earlier, right? I'm just going to quick label them quickly, label them an electrical scale hard. Resilient flexibility, agility, right, soft leadership, and social influence.
27:10
Soft, creative thinking, soft motivation, self-awareness, soft. Technological literacy, heart empathy, active listening, soft curiosity, soft talent management, service orientation, and customer service soft. This is also along with the lines that these are more product driven. Is this more people driven right? As you can imagine, service oriented. The customer service is very much a people facing, uh positions, so you know that's that sort of gave you an idea.
27:41
Okay, but that's 20, 25. That's this year. What about 20 and 30? So, the top 10 fast growing skills, right? A list over here? And do a very quick labeling as well. The top three are hard skills like AI, big data networks, and cyber security, technological literacy right, and the next few are soft skills.
28:05
Okay, and then you go to analytical thinking, hard skills, and then environmental stewardship. Just some notes about the environmental stewardship computers mainly about leadership, right? Because we don't even know how do we solve this climate change right now, so you know, environmental at large, that how do we make it more friendly for people and for the Earth, right?
28:25
So, therefore, many questioning about leadership. Therefore, it is a soft skill. Um. So, what's striking here is right. Well, technology is advancing rapidly. The skills that set people apart and help them thriving the world are actually deeply human. So, you will notice, right? There is no emotional intelligence listed on this on here, like, explicitly.
28:54
But it's everywhere. So scales like resilience, leadership, active listening, curiosity, self-awareness, empathy, and so on. So forth, you know, all stem from emotional intelligence. An even creative thinking and talent management require right emotional grounding to be applied effectively. So hard skills like Ai and data are important. And they will get you into the door.
29:23
But soft skills. What I would also call a sort of very broad bucket of human-centered skills surrounded by EQ keeps you at the table and also take you to the top. And you also notice between these two reports, right? Five year apart. This is a projection. This is where we are, and all of those are the common skills that.
29:49
Um, people are looking for.
29:54
So, this is what I call human human skills grounded by emotional intelligence. So, in the AI world, the humanoid advantage is actually more human skills. Let me tell you why. So, here's where hiring manager. Contributed to that record, say AI. Literacy skills are key differentiator for job Seekers. So they were not even consider you if you don't even have that as part of your perform, right?
30:20
That's from. If you look at a job market supply demand that's from demand. Standpoint what people is looking for? What company is looking for? Then, let's look at LinkedIn, right? The member since 2023, number of AI literacy skills being added has increased by. So, I think people realized, oh, demand is there.
30:41
Therefore, we needed to. Uh, to upgrade our skills right in order to meet the demand. Furthermore, that's more on the hard scale side on AI driven. And here is soft skills are increasingly important in the rows that we once less likely to Value human skills, but the importance become more and more.
31:04
Um and. Um, what organizations focus on the hire people is, you have to thinking about what AI can now do? And those tasks that require the unique human skills that all business needs. So, I would summarize this. Idea of, you know? In the AI driven world, what skill isn't critical?
31:28
Hard skill getting other job. It's just like a rock at the bottom right. That's a solid foundation. You must have that in order to obtain the position, um, you know, career that you wanted. However, soft skills take you to the top. So, if you're looking into your like skill inventory that you have hard skills, right?
31:48
And you might be a subject matter expert. You might be very Advanced on IEI, but I would argue also that if you utilize soft skill, well, if you grow yourself skill, it could have become a soft power. Take you to the top. So, to answer this question why human-centered intelligence matters?
32:10
Because the skills? Set your part in AI driven word. Timely discussion that we are having here. Um. And. We're gonna discover more. So, the next chapter, what are we going to talk about is? How did I really put a class together? Um, and I remember, one of my superpower is.
32:33
Toyota systems that scale, so I believe it is actually a system, not just a thing. Okay, so, uh, we had some earlier whole question. Okay, are my hair show up? Oh, it's cool. It's nice. All right. So, do you think you have too little or too much emotional intelligence for your job?
32:55
Okay, look at the reason this is fresh, right? Just happened. It was 241 of you. So too much, uh, emotional intelligence. Oh, that's very interesting. So, 38% people are thinking you have too much. I'm curious, you know, later on when we have q a in the comment section wanted to learn why, and the 26 percent thinking too little.
33:16
And there's also 36, uh. Thinking, not sure? Okay, very interesting. There's no right or wrong, answer, you know? It's a, it's a. It's a large enough sample size, so it's something for us to think about it. Okay. So before we enter into the course design and I have a question right, what is intelligence and I actually consulted a childgbt?
33:44
Um, today's guiding. This is, they also give us to me. So, intelligence is a system of awareness and responses, right? It is how we're absorb information intellectually emotional socially. And then we try to make sense out of it. And then we act the skillfully in a very complex environment.
34:00
Okay, that's nice. Okay. Then, it's at a core intelligence is ability to learn, understand, apply knowledge to adapt to solve problems and create value. So, I think all of those make sense, and it's a very like. Ai type of answer? So, I want to show you a version and one of the things one of the quotes I love the most from a human being.
34:29
What is intelligence? Intelligence is what you use when you don't know what to do. Wow! I think that's powerful. Right? And I give you an, uh, quite reason to but a very fun example is, when do we need intelligence here? Okay, so this happened last week. Our neighborhood caught the baby ducks her, you know, slipped into the grape.
35:00
And we're trying to figure out how to take them out. And you see the baby duck is? Uh, calling the mom the mom is yelling screaming for help.
35:17
Yeah, so I don't think any of us was trained to, you know, deal with situation like that, but it's it's kind of an emergency, you know, it just happened, and we just have to do it. Sorry, exactly like what the code is, say, intelligence, and what do you use when you don't know what to do?
35:32
Okay, next page. All right, so we also sorry, uh, this is the second poll question here by K Emotional intelligence be learned. Wow, we have 90 people said yes. Oh, that's a good answer. I like it, one person said. No, okay, just one person out of 196, okay, uh, later.
35:51
I hope to talk to you. And then we have 10, I decided, maybe. If you added this 90 plus, the 10 we always have hundred, percent of you said it can be learned again. There's no right or wrong? Crochet, you know, I obviously have my opinion, right, and my perspective, but your perspective is, is, you know, worth the same, uh, you know, to be respected as well, so that's interesting.
36:18
Um. So when it comes to the science behind the course that I designed, I'd like to share this one.
36:28
So, there is a model. By a social scientist.
36:38
And he helps us to understand how human behavior is shaped across three levels. What are those three levels, human nature, culture and personality? And let's break them down. So, the first one is human nature, right, which is at a base that this is in a universal and biological. So all human shares basic instincts.
37:03
For example, I got like a village to save this two baby ducks. Why, because it would care for the yeah, we wanted to, you know, care about life. We wanted to be able to save them. So, you know, when you come to, like basic instincts, like, example, like, hunger, fear, love, you know, connection, care for the young, and it's what makes human human, right?
37:27
So, the second level the middle level is culture, right? This layer? Is actually learned and shared by groups. And our value. Custom language and Norms come from the communities we grew up in, whether that Community being you know can be very loose. Com. Definition of culture group, right? It can be a country.
37:51
It can be organization. It can be families. And. This group of two 248 right happened to spend this 90 minutes together. We have a coaching here, which this is a group, because we all care about emotional intelligence, right, right? So, culture shift shapes how we see the word and how we relate to each other.
38:14
And the top level is personality. Personality is specific to individual. And it's shaped by both our genetics and also our unique experience. I mean, can we point to one person on this like 248 group? We had the same experience. We went to the same school, but we probably still, you know, associate with different people, right?
38:38
Probably joined a different class, even if we join the different the same class, right? It could be a different cohort, so it's hardly I don't think anyone can point out even a girl from the same family, you know. I have two older sisters, yeah, three of us, but we totally turns out differently, so the experience is could be very different.
38:56
Um, and it's Unique to everybody. And so some of us. Turns out to be more introverted. Some of more extroverts, some may be more assertive. Some of us may be more conservative, right? So, this is what make us individual that distinct from one to the other? So, but what?
39:17
Why does this matter right to emotional intelligence and Leadership? Because to lead well? To lead. Well, to be a good leader, we must understand where behaviors come from. What is the universal? What is the culture and what is personal? So, I love this framework. I love it so much, and I embedded integrate this framework into my course design.
39:42
So, here's a course map. How many modules do we have? You know, where do we go through this? Um, in a quarter time. First of all is emotional. Intelligence is at largest. Components of the course. It started with personal intelligence. And then goes to culture intelligence. And then goes to social intelligence and then leadership intelligence.
40:06
So, personal intelligence would emphasize our stress, understanding driven, strange driven self-awareness. And then on the coaching intelligence we emphasize across cross-culture. Um, and sort of seek you, you know, like, culture, intelligence, right, CQ, and then, um, social intelligence is largely based on influence, because not all of us has authority to tell other people what to do, you know of interest?
40:34
Get us the impact that we are looking for. And then leadership intelligence is largely built on authenticity, and all of those are incremental. Let me tell you what it cost. We started from ourselves, right? I mean, do we understand ourselves who we are, what we're representing, so personal intelligence?
40:54
What stress do we have. What weakness do we have, but that's why individual the moment you interact with another person? I want to say a group could be as small as two people. Right. All of a sudden, you start having any culture element to it. And then we are all actually in multiple.
41:14
I don't even know if you count, like how many groups that I am interacting with, you know, as part of my life, too many right, the school, you know, the family, the larger family, the small family, your work, your department, your occupation, your industry, your country, the city, the state, the list are going on right.
41:31
All of those gave us some answers a new, um, some part of our culture. And then. So, when multiple group? Interrupted with each other that become a society. So, therefore, it's a social intelligence. And then, finally, all of those increments. If you understand all of that you build. You build intelligence in those modules and then eventually lead to.
41:55
How do we become a great leader that we aspire to be? But this is emotional intelligence module. Oftentimes, I say this is a black box, so something happened here. I don't even know what happened. What process internally, I? That reaction happened, right? That actually happened that emotional triggered me.
42:17
I don't know what exactly happened, right? So it's like, kind of like a black box. So? I figure this is not enough because Black Box is nice to thinking it's a magic box, but it's, you know, how would we learn from it, right? It's not enough. So, whatever, coming in can impact to influence to drive this black box becomes super important.
42:37
So, I add this thinking skill module. So thinking. Is where we started as a as a source that we absorbed, right, whether whatever information that you're able to take? And then feed into this magic box. And then what happens? There's communication. I mean, you try to communicate whatever you think whatever you process in the intelligence.
43:07
Um, machine, and then you try to tell other people articulating whatever your thoughts are. So, I viewed this as a more completed system. Because you have an input. Becoming the output. Everything else in between is work in progress. So, this is the course map, which means that it goes through all the six module, and then we try to bring them together.
43:33
Any objective. So, now, let's launch poll question number three to six. So, the course objective is actually. Solving complex problems. Okay, let me tell you I have this three steps without the we don't have time to go into depths today, so it's just a framework. Just, you know, you have an idea.
43:57
So a represent where you are now? Okay. In a situation, B represent the ideal stage ideal outcome you wanted to develop. So a is where you are. B is kind of destination. You want to get to. However, most of the time when we have a complex problem right, you kind of understand the way you are.
44:20
It's actually quite difficult. In some cases, so complicated and so intertwined with any or other relationship and the priority, so a is even difficult to Define, but for illustration purposes. A assuming you someone understand it, B you have a, you know, an idea that what would improve the situation?
44:41
The outcome might look like, but anyway, between A and B, is kind of, uh, messy, right? You don't know how to get there? Um, so that's step one really trying to understand where you are, where you want to be. Step two is try to develop some strategy and some options here, right?
44:58
So well, you could take this pass there. Maybe, you know, I could also take another pass here, but all of them will get me to the destination. So, the last step is to really be evaluating those options and trying to pick the best one. And the best one fit into whatever the environment and resources.
45:20
That you have at that moment. So I would have called the first one is. Do you have a vision? Let's develop a vision right to start. How do you solve the problem if you solve it. What that might look like. Step two is strategy. Let's develop some strategy and step three is really execution, right?
45:38
But this class is going to take this to the next level because what I care most about is a Clear Vision. For both A and B, okay? Also viable strategy. You can come up with beautiful options, but if you don't, if you like, you know, not have enough resources to do it.
45:55
Don't get enough support to do. There's a dead ending between there. This is not a viable strategy, so we care about it. Here is how many viable strategies can take you from A to B within the current environment that you're able to develop. And finally, when you're trying to execute it, right?
46:12
Everything is dynamic. A is going to change B is going to change and maybe even, uh, you know, in between, everything has changed. So, it's going to be a dynamic environment for complex problems. Um, so I think it's a dynamic execution plan. So, that's sort of the outcome of the course is okay.
46:31
If you do well in this class, what are we looking for right to be successful? So, what does success look like for the students? And I have also have some real world application for you, and this is not just in theory. This is a very practical, and here are some scenarios that my students have solved in the class.
46:52
For example, career Advancement. I had a student come to me 4 years ago. She struggled with promotion. She's working for a beautiful tech company, a large local pet company in San Diego, actually. But she struggled with promotion, and I was so happy after class six months. Maybe there has to be?
47:13
Hello! Okay, I'll keep going. Second, one relationship, right, relationship is important for us, and this class developed tools that you're able to enhance your relationship and conflict resolution. Family issues and stakeholder management, so those are real cases that students brought to the class and we together apply the tools and learnings, and this is pretty solved.
47:37
And if you have a hard time to remember that three steps I use this analogy Google Maps, right. Where Google Map does is you enter in the starting points. Okay, in this case is, I was in Japan, so this is a Prince Sakura Tower Hotel in Tokyo. My destination, I'm trying to get to Wasilla University, right?
47:57
So, Google Map gave me options. Here are three options. You know, you can take see one. You can also take 39, 19. I don't know if that's a Highway or something, and you can also take something else, right? So, it's up to me. How do I choose it? I mean, I wanted to avoid highway.
48:14
I want the fastest. Are the things I talk about valuable options right here. Clear destination, Clear Vision, and then a choice whatever fit me the best at that moment. And, uh. We also have a few guests from Rosita University joining us today, so thank you for joining us and hopefully you enjoy this class as well.
48:37
So, designing the intelligence system, right? If the goal is ready to provide a practical, intelligent framework, and that fits you, I remember all of us are different. If you talk about personal, intelligent culture into a social leadership, all of that are different. We have different thinking Styles, different thinking capabilities, communication as well.
48:55
So it will be a system customized just for you. The next chapter that we are going to talk about is. I like to think about if you before you start leading anyone else. I mean, I think the first thing is really check out yourself. Uh, practice the self-leadership. That's where we're going to begin, and this is going to be the first module that on my course map for personal intelligence.
49:20
This is probably like 50, maybe 30 to 50 of that content. Okay, just just give you an idea. All right, so we also had this poll question, let's see. Hey, the result is already in. So recent shows that most people believe they are self-aware. Do you know how many percent actually fit that criteria?
49:41
Okay, so we have most people choose 10 to 15 percent. Right. There are people also chosen 2035 to 10. Yeah, so the answer is actually 10 to 15 percent. So, what do you think about it, right? I mean, we really, do we really know? Do we really know ourselves?
49:57
I think 10 to 15% is quite low, which means out of, um, you know, 10 people. There's only one, and when I have people actually know themselves? Well, that's pretty low, right? So, there's something we could do about it, I hope. So, let's talk about the self-awareness. Since this is?
50:17
Um, at some chapter, you know, we're going to enter. What is self-awareness? Self-awareness is actually value passion aspiration. Um, how you fit with the environment? Your impact on others and also your reaction that including your thoughts, your feelings, the behaviors, strengths, and weakness. And self-awareness actually have two sides.
50:43
One is internal self-awareness. And is how clearly you understand your own value. Emotions and patterns. An internal self-awareness. Is positively associated with job and happiness. A relationship satisfaction, as well as social control. However, it's negatively associated with. Anxiety, stress, and depression. Okay. On the other hand, I give you an example about the internal self-awareness before we leave.
51:14
Here is, for example, you realize you tend to overcome it. Not just for not just from four planning standpoint, you cannot claim, say, well, I didn't plan. Well, I didn't do time management well, but it is actually because. You don't want to disappointing others. So, when people make a request, you just say, yes.
51:36
Right? So, that's an example about internal self-awareness. Um, and then on the other hand is external setup awareness. External self-awareness is how well you understand how others experiencing you. And. It is actually positively associated with empathy and perspective taking because you care about how others see you, how others perceive you, right.
52:01
We also have a phrase called perception is reality. So, regardless how you, for example, the earlier we talked about the overcrements, right? I mean, you know, internally, it's because you don't want to disappoint in others. Therefore, you keep committing to the things that actually. You don't have time to do, but from other people's perspective, they might thinking, oh, it's just a poor time management.
52:30
Right? Or is it Pro plating? See, you see, there's? A gapping between. And then example for external Reserve orders is you think you're being efficient in your meetings right in meetings, but others actually see you impatient or dismissive. Because efficiency is important for you, you know, therefore, you drive the agenda you keep moving forward.
52:52
The people is, like, no, no, I want it. And you know, she doesn't have enough patient to listen to us, right? And she's being too dismissive. I mean you see those a lot actually in performance review, you know from, like my industry experience, sometimes you see the performance reveal peer feedback or 360 degree feedback.
53:08
You were shocked that what I was trying to do this, but people actually perceived to me that way, but? Mind perception is reality, unless you do something to correct it. So, the key here is, you can't be self-aware on the inside, but blind on the outside, or maybe vice versa, right?
53:28
But leadership requirbles. Knowing who you are and also how you affect others. So, we had this full question when it comes to internal, external self-awareness. Does that being high on one type, meaning being high on the other? Okay. So, most people answer, no, some people said, yes, some people said, not sure, let's see.
53:51
It's the correct answer is no. And you will see a lot more explanation later on. Um, you know why that's the case? Quickly move on. Which one is more important? Internal, external self-awareness? Okay, so internal. 24% most people, almost 70 percent, said equally important. I think you got right.
54:14
It is equally important, and again, I'm going to show you. So, here is. And we call it self-awareness archetype, and this is a tool by two framework. Okay. So? Here, we launched poll question number seven last night. Thank you. Um, so? On the X, right? You have? External self-awareness from low to high on the Y.
54:44
You have this. Internals of avoidance from low to high as well. And it's been categorized. It depends on which quadril you are or that particular person is. And to become four different time. Uh, go through each type and some examples that you might recognize at workplace or your daily life.
55:11
So, first of all, Um, this intro introspectors, right? So, they're clear, uh, what? Who? They are. I don't know, but don't challenge their own views or search for blind spot by getting feedback from others. And this can harm their relationships and limit their success. Right? An example would be a leader who see themselves.
55:37
Um, as thoughtful and strategic. But their team finds them hard to approach and aware of Team Dynamics. All right, so you think you know who you are? You show up, but your team somehow received you in a very different way. But then you don't reach out to check out to check what they think about you their perspective.
55:58
Therefore, you're blindsided, right? So, the second one? Is? Uh, let's pick The Seekers, right? So, Seekers are low internal self-awareness. Uh, also low external self-awareness. Or they're a little bit lost, right? They don't know who they are yet. And what they stand for. And also how their team system.
56:26
So as a result, you might be working very hard. You try and better her, but you get stuck and frustrated. Right, and it started impacting your performance and relationships. So, the next one is pleaser. So they can be so focused on appearing a certain way to others. And they could be overlooking what matters to them.
56:45
So, over the time, they tend to make choices that aren't in service of their own success. No end of fulfillment, right? An example earlier that over commitment because I don't wanted to disappoint others is a classic example of Pleasers. It's just thinking about from performance standpoint right over the time you keep repeating the same pattern.
57:06
Then, what happened, then your performance got impacted because you committed so much better? You don't deliver, right? Where aware is people know who they are, what they wanted to accomplish, but at the same time, they also seek how the value and value others. Opinion, right? This is where you high on both internal and external, and this is where actually leaders begin to fully realize the true benefits of self-awareness.
57:35
So, let's. Uh, okay. So, uh, I am going to give you some examples, and we, we dive a little deeper in each type, um. Let's look at this question first, because this leads to the very next slides that we talk about one of the time. So, do people always learn from experience and does expertise always help people root out false information?
57:58
Okay, so we have more than 60. People said no, and we have right experience does give us a lot. Um. We always learn from experience, right? That's the reason. However, I have this, like, I remember one of the interview that I had is, um, I advise the people is sometimes you fail because you, you learn from failure, right?
58:22
Argue. Sometime, you will fail. You'll feel miserably, but actually, you don't know what you have learned. Cuz you either too busy. Either too overwhelmed. Feel frustrated and angry and confused, and you don't know how you failed. And you not be able to figure out no one else can tell you either right.
58:42
So that can be an example is. Yes, we have a lot of experience, but not necessary is learning. I would focus on that if you have a valuable learning that's more, uh, important, right? So most people said no, and the answer is also no. So, let me show you another case here.
59:00
Do people always learn from experience? This is an hbr article. What self-awareness really is, right? Um, so here's a cat and looking to. The mirror, saying, well, now I'm growing so much. I have so much experience. Okay, so now, all of a sudden, you see the mirror. It's actually a lion, right?
59:17
You grill! Um, however, from experience, right, assuming your senior leader actually have fewer people above them, who can provide a candid feedback? I gone through this myself at one point for my career. I used to have always friends to eat lunch with me, but at one point, people start keeping distance from me, so I don't no longer have those lunch friends.
59:42
The people that work for me work around me, you know, so that's just reality. Secondly, highly experienced people. Credit can keep us from doing our homework because we think we know so much. Amy, have you always hear like I've been there? I've done that. Oh, I know that. That is, unfortunately, as an indicator lack of self-awareness.
01:00:03
Regardless how much experience you already have? Next one, you could overestimate your skills and abilities. Remember, we talk about this A to B, and everything is dynamic. And even if you had a vision header strategy, but things happen still dynamically, it could change B could change. Those are the things we need to keep in mind, right?
01:00:23
Uh, a different situation requires different solution, right? So never. Not overestimate the skills and ability that we have acquired. Those are your essence, but don't overestimate that. And also as once power grow. Once willingness to lessen strings well that remind us the video, you just worked, right? So goes through that period of her time that she feels like she has the power.
01:00:47
Now, she doesn't have to listen to the enemy, and then she regret. Later, she went back to apologize, and then that's how she learned okay. And if people fear to hurt their career to give you their to give their boss a constructive feedback? Yeah, let's be honest, right? How many people are able to and willing to and dare to give their boss?
01:01:14
Right, it's hard. So? Well, even so. To summarize this, actually experience and power could hinder your self-awareness. So, remember this cat, and then whatever the cat sees in the mirror, right? That could be the first archetype we just talk about interspectors. Because experience and power hinder self-awareness here, you think you know who you are, but you don't seek?
01:01:40
How other people see you? That's important to be aware. Okay, so next one? So, think of your house, right? We asked this poll question is a think of your life as a house. Can you knock down the wall between the room and be the same person in each one.
01:01:57
I love this question, and I had such Insight of a discussion with every one of my cohort about this question, and also my speakers. And there's a reason why that we had those questions and why this question is is worthwhile for you to think about it. Think of life as a house, right?
01:02:13
We all individual.
01:02:19
But you also belong to groups. I don't even humming groups, but we also like, somewhat, a part of group members. The group again could also mean family, right, any sort of group more than you know, starting one, plus one yourself, plus someone else. That's a group. And then away.
01:02:38
Also, Society members, right? And then, finally, we all play some sort of role as the leaders, whether it's professionally personally in your social life, you know, with your friends, right? With your children, so it's like, okay, so now you were. You play different roles, right? Life is a house.
01:02:58
You're in different. You know, all those health that you wear all this road you play? Are you the same person or not? Okay, so let's look at our result here, right? 150% said no. Interesting. And then you know about 30 people said yes. And then we also have people said, not sure.
01:03:20
So, this is very typical when I ask that question because it's such an Insight of our question. It takes time to go through that, and we're actually checking throughout the quarter. You know about the same question over and over? So, this is where the Seeker is right. Where am I?
01:03:35
Where am I? I mean, you kind of lost in the fall. Um, and maybe different time. When people ask questions, you have different answers. So, there's no, not right or wrong. Answer space, so you understand sometime will flow between those archetyped as well, right? So the next one? There is actually a downside of being very emotional intelligence.
01:03:57
I want to emphasize very emotional intelligence. That's where the downside coming from. Remember the story. We talk about a pleaser, you know. You don't want to disappointing other people here. It comes right, because when you don't want to disappoint, you don't want it to. People, then the creativity Innovation because it takes you to break whatever the status quo, right.
01:04:18
There will be some people unhappy, so it's impossible everybody's happy, therefore, you know, you're going to King. You're going to prevent block the creativity and Innovation potential. It's also very difficult to give people. Constructive negative feedback is also hard for you to receive feedback because you heard people's feeling if not others.
01:04:39
You're feeling as well, right? And then. But very emotional, intelligent people. I mean, we talk about quarter case. Here is not only their emotional intelligence, but they also will develop an ability to manipulate others, so sometimes that you had a relationship with certain people. All of a sudden, you feel like, oh, my gosh, I was just being manipulated.
01:05:01
You realize that I doubled. I have a question on that is warning on. That is, people are smart, so they're going to figure out along the way if you can trick them once, but not all the time and also aversion to risk, right? Because risk.
01:05:20
And so, you know, it's going to be hard for you. This is where we'll talk about here, you know this. The Pleasers are Harmony seeking and a conflict averse. Finally, I want to play this short. Find the optimal balance of thinking and emotion. We cannot divorce emotions from thinking the two are completely intertwined.
01:05:42
But there is inevitably a dominant Factor. Some people more clearly governed by emotions than others. What we are looking for is the proper ratio and balance the one that leads to the most effective action. The ancient Greeks had an appropriate metaphor for this, the writer and the horse. The horse is our emotional nature, continually impelling us to move.
01:06:04
This horse has tremendous energy and power, but without a rider, it cannot be guided. It is wild, subject to predators and continually heading into trouble. The rider is our thinking self through training and practice. It holds the reins and guides the horse, transforming this powerful animal energy into something productive.
01:06:24
The one without the other is useless without the rider. No directed movement or purpose without the horse. No energy, no power. Most people, the horse dominates, and the rider is weak. Some people. The rider is too strong, holds the reins too tightly, and is afraid to occasionally let the animal go into a gallon.
01:06:44
Horse and Rider must work together. This means we consider our actions beforehand. We bring as much thinking as possible to a situation before we make a decision. But once we decide what to do, we loosen the reins and interaction with boldness and a spirit of Adventure. Instead of being slaves to this energy, we Channel it.
01:07:04
That is the essence of rationality. I love this analogy, you know, the horse and? Um, the writer. So, think about where you are. In terms of your emotional. Intelligence, I mean, are you able to work with the horse? Is that balanced, right? So, we talk about balance, and it's self-aware here.
01:07:26
This is what we earlier talk about. This is where leader fully utilize the true benefits of self-awareness. Training practice together, right, in different situation? You know, in my challenge, is you in a different way, but ultimately, we want to be able to find this optimal balance. And keep practicing on that.
01:07:48
So, this gave you a summary of self-awareness and all archetypes that we talked about it. Um, okay, let's look at this pole. Which server will best fit you? Beautiful, so I have people all answered. I mean, there's, you know? Every archetype has some people feel like that's where they are today.
01:08:10
The question for you will be if that's where you are. Is that where you want it to be? But if not, if yes, congratulations? If not, what can we do? Okay, so. I love this quote. Pay attention to your patterns. The way you learn to survive may not be the same way you want to continue to live.
01:08:34
Heel and shift. So, thinking about in the context of self-awareness. Are you happy where you are, what you have? Pick an answer which you have observed in the pattern for yourself. So heal and grow. That's what I might hope you would do. And we talk about those, uh, you know?
01:08:58
Internal cell phone is there are tools that we can do actually. Before we start the class, we have a little conversation going on with people. Join us a little earlier, and there's different tools that you can use. And here are, you know, three tools that I picked. I hear at least two people is familiar with Clifton strength, right?
01:09:13
So they're all different, um, given the time, because I'm not going to go through the details, but you know they're all useful. So, whichever tool that you're using, I think it's good for you. And you know? Checking into those tools and better understand the internal self-awareness. Um, if you're part of the cohort, we're going to use trans profile.
01:09:37
We've been using that and very happy with it. Um, it based on a few things the energy performance-based strengths, so it's energy and performance. That's the thing that, um, I have a later slide to show you as well, and 60 strengths across four categories. Okay, you're going to see in the next slides as well, what, energize, and it drinks you?
01:09:57
Oh, that is very unique and useful. And because, why is that matter, because if energized me. I wanted to do more. I'm happier that my performance, therefore, is better, right, and I feel superpowered that when I started utilizing those strings, you know, if it drinks me, I feel tired very quickly.
01:10:15
I'm exhausted, I hate doing that, you know, I just don't want to move forward. Of course. My performance is in question as well, so. Um. I'm gonna show. Okay, so here's a commissary. Your growth strategy looks like double down the strengths patch, the weak spot, a bit of both.
01:10:33
Okay, a bit of both is depending on the day, right? So okay, that's interesting. All right, so most people is thinking about strengths of weakness, both needs some work, right? And we have, let's see, Double Down the stress, owning 13%, all right. So, assuming you know yourself right through those tools, we just talk about your stress weakness.
01:10:55
What do you do well? What do you don't do? Well, okay, some understanding. This is where this tool is going to give it to you. It's going to give you two into 60 strands into four categories, so realize the strength. Which means that energizing you, you enjoy doing that.
01:11:10
You feel so happy you feel so empowered, right? When you're doing that, the advice here is used wisely, because if you overuse it, that might become a different outcome. Okay, the second one is you do have those strengths, but you don't have opportunity to use because depends on your environment depends on what your priority and focus.
01:11:30
So, even you have this hidden right assets of stress, but you really don't have enough opportunity to use it. Here is saying try to use more right, knowing that you have it and try to practice that. And then you go to learn the behavior is. This is a very interesting category because people think you do so well.
01:11:49
In this category, I give you an example for myself. When I was at Apple at early stage, right, and I, we crunching numbers because I'm a supply chain person, I have to know how many supplies what's the yield? What's the production, you know, input output and all of that.
01:12:03
Where's the shipment? So I'm good with numbers, uh, and people also think I'm super detail oriented only I knew. It actually drains my energy. I probably needed to double of my effort to get that, right? But, yeah, I did it very well, and I got a promoted. Probably, you know, part of because contributing to this category, but only myself know that.
01:12:24
That's not something I really enjoy doing, but I have to do it because that's part of my job. And then weakness is. Another thing is just to, you know, a weakness that we have, and the advisors try to use less. But how can you, you know, in some area that you have to right to use in them?
01:12:40
You know what we do? The model is suggesting to utilize your stress to overcome your wickedness. It's not about to forget about your weaknesses working on your weakness in a smart way in an energized way. Um, you know, so utilize some of the stress to overcome that. What I like about this model is a performance energy, and it's very Dynamic will change as a person.
01:13:02
If once the environment changed, we also change and the 60 strengths family also change. So it's a dynamic model. It's not a fixed. It's not like I, this is who I am. Now, I'm introverted for every introvert. No, this is my strength profile, and when I use more of my unrealized strengths, I become better performance, right?
01:13:20
And also, when there's major life event happen. For example, all of a sudden become an educator I used to be in a practitioner. My strength profile change as well because I got a chance to utilize some of the stress I did not have before. Okay. But the question is, okay.
01:13:36
Now, how do you practice your external self-awareness, right? Important. There are many ways you could do, for example, pick the right person to ask for feedback, right? Uh, and be very specific about what you want to know. If you're going to a meeting if you have someone you trust, you can say, you know, would you watch me present and let me know what I can do better?
01:13:57
Be very specific and pay more attention to people's reaction, because sometimes you say, well, I did this how calmly react totally different than what I anticipated. You know, checking on that, talk to them about it, what happened there right, and in which watch, where do people treat you differently?
01:14:13
It's similar a category, and they create any imaginary therapist. I would also say, well, AI probably could be like charging BT. I talked to church G every day. Now you know, that can be something I did this. I don't feel very good at. What do you think or something?
01:14:28
Just imagining in your mind, you know, you could even give that therapist a name, right, just to be, um? Playful, and then also perform a friend audit. You know, if you have friends, you really trust, and that's where you could give feedback. And they could also give feedback to you.
01:14:44
And again, some of those points reminded me about about Sue's story. Again, you know, how did that go? It helped her tremendously, right? So practice external self-awareness, and also when you practice external self-awareness, bring your best friend. His name or her name is curiosity super important. So, I want to say feedback is important.
01:15:10
I also treat feedback as a gift. I love what Adam Grant said. You know, productive givers focus on acting in the long-term best interest of others. Even if it's not pleasant. But, you know, you have courage to give it to them. They may not be happy at that moment, but throughout the time they realize and come to a trust and respect as a return.
01:15:34
So the key takeaways? Let's launch poll question number 10. The key takeaways for this chapter right again. This is my maybe 30 40 percent of, um, you know, the personal intelligence module we talk about earlier. So, remember, emotional intelligence is a strategic Advantage, especially in an AI driven world.
01:15:51
Secondly, self-awareness has two sides, right? I sometimes blame the name because it says self-awareness is, like, yeah, do I know myself? Remember, you have another size, which is external, how people experience you'll perceive you. Number three leader with stress, not just fix your weakness. You only have so many hours in your day.
01:16:11
So much energy and resources. Focus on your strengths. Try to utilize your strengths to overcome your weakness. And lastly, feedback is a gift. Use it well. I will leave that you with this quotes. Um, to end, this chapter is Master. Others is strengths. Master yourself is true power. As I mentioned, your beginning of the chapter.
01:16:39
Leadership starts with yourself. Lead yourself before you're able to lead others.
01:16:49
Hey, so that's the last poll question. Okay? I can't move forward. I can come back here. So, I wanted to bring it all together. Build your own house of intelligence. Okay, so what do I mean by that you're familiar with this model now? So, this is where you really see personal intelligence, which is personality.
01:17:07
The top of the pyramid? You see the coaching intelligence, which is specific for group and learn the behavior, and then you also see them human nature, right? So, we bring all of those together as different modules. And this is how you build it. We work on the critical and the creative thinking skills which make the high quality input for this magic black box.
01:17:30
And then we talked about personal intelligence, strengths based cultural intelligence, and social intelligence. How do you influence others? And then. All of this build a solid foundation for you to become an authentic leader. And then you're able to communicate beautifully through a storytelling and negotiation. So, this is what I mean by cause of intelligence.
01:17:56
And let's go back to that question. Here. So, we said, which one action you would take to grow your self-awareness, right? So, let's see here. Okay, the biggest category is 30 percent 31 percent reflected before reaction, beautiful. All right, the second one is ask for feedback regularly. Great, and I observe how others respond to me.
01:18:21
Important explore tools better, understand myself. Yes, utilize tour whatever you can find. You know, even the internal? Uh, stress tour that we're talking about. It doesn't matter which tool as long as you're able to utilize it. Thanks, okay here. All right. So how do you go from here right now?
01:18:44
You take a little bit of class and I want to welcome you to joining this community, you know, Oceanside perspective, the non-profit that I have funded. We have all those content out there and most of. Are recorded actually in the class. And uh. So, for example, here we have the ding of Brady here, Lisa.
01:19:04
We talk about authenticity that was beautiful. Story between Lisa and Nana, you know, another board member of op Oceanside perspective op and she is also in the. Chip, uh, what is that semiconductor industry right? And we also have other beautiful stories, and you can also scan the QR code or get you to a newsletter that we will announce the new content, um, and events that we will host in the future.
01:19:31
So welcome. And you're also welcome to follow the YouTube, um, you know, and Linkedin. We have very active. Community over there. Um, it's summer. Everybody talk about books, so if you have time, those are the books historically recommended by our speakers, and so feel free to dive into the list, um, and enjoy reading, um, to just practice and gain more knowledge about emotional intelligence.
01:19:59
Um, so why you build your house of intelligence because you live here? And it's time to build it well. And you start now! So, now it's your turn. Ask question. Share your comments and. You know, make connection, if you like. And if you like to connect with me, uh, LinkedIn, please type in micro MBA.
01:20:20
So, I know who you are because so many people want to connect. I usually don't. Um, but if I know it's you, I will be more than welcome. To connect it with you. So okay, we already what happened. We got a question. Who raised the hand earlier. I did not see.
01:20:38
Can you stop sharing for a moment so I said yes, Alan? Please unmute yourself, go ahead. Yes, thank you so much. This has been great. Today, I just have a question is, I mean, because? We can trick ourselves into thinking that we are, you know, we have emotional intelligence, and that we're aware.
01:20:59
And of course, I'm always trying to figure out. Is there a way I can? Test do a quantifiable test. That can help me. See where I'm at. Is there something like that or really? Is it it? Are they? Are they a bunch of these different things that you take?
01:21:16
And so I wondered if there's something that you could. You could kind of just say if you were really honest and kick the test, and it would show you where you're at. If there's something like that, the first thing I really think there's a perfect solution. Um, for that, however, if you really interested, there are EQ tests that you could.
01:21:34
You could find out there. I used to see a booklet, but. I don't know what they're based on, so you know, it's like, you have IQ tests. And there's also an Eco test. Um, but I'm not really advocating for those because I feel like the foundation of that test, uh, you know, I'm not convinced.
01:21:54
And the other question I had about emotional intelligence is there. Is there any correlation hopefully as you get chronologically mature as you get older that you would in fact have more emotional intelligence? Is there any correlation between that that I mean, or is there none? I mean, there's just some people in Earth.
01:22:17
Absolutely! No, you're right! Beautiful question! There's absolutely a correlation, because if you're thinking about emotional intelligence, it's really in a human Center intelligence, right? So the more you go through, the more experience the more learnings that you have. It's supposed to help your emotional intelligence, so I also, for example, teach different class, but the undergrads and I always see this huge gap between my exactly MBA cohort for emotional intelligence, and in my undergrads 200 students, you know, yeah, you're in a very different spectral in terms of emotional intelligence.
01:22:49
However, right, this whole experience and the power thing. Sometimes I hinder your emotional intelligence. That's something we need to be aware because we need to balance. It's not only because I'm, you know, I'm older. Now, I'm 30 years older than before. Therefore, I'm a lot more, not necessarily. Everything is changing, including ourselves, so as always.
01:23:12
Your self-awareness and all other things I think. I think it will get to a point that, yes. The more I sometimes call, like age, bring us intelligence first of all and then wisdom. That's good. Thank you. You're welcome. Yes, awake. Hi! So, my question is that the different rules that we discussed, like where introspective?
01:23:38
These can also diff depend based on the situation or the environment you're in. So, for example, I tend to find myself that in my previous space, when I was a PhD student, I was more of a pleaser. But now, I have turned to be more introspective. So, how do we sort of balance that?
01:23:57
And what's your perspective on it? Yeah, I love this question. In fact, I was just reflecting this week. I'm, like, yeah, there's four, Quattro, you know, where am I? I can tell you that usually. I feel like I'm in the aware category, but when it comes to my family, my mother, my sisters.
01:24:12
Oh my gosh, I all of a sudden become this pleaser because I'm the youngest member in my family. I supposed to cheer them up as opposed to solve problems for them. So, the truth is, we are, um. Shift within. This four different type depends on the situation, depends on the stage of life you are in.
01:24:31
Maybe depends, you know, sometimes the position. The more your senior, you cannot be a pleaser. Probably, you know, to climb up the corporate ladder, become like a pleaser senior executive, right? You don't see a lot of people because you have to make hard decisions somewhere, you know? Um, so you're absolutely right.
01:24:48
Um, I think it depends on the situation, but I think largely you want to know, like, okay, during this period of time, I feel like I'm more leaning towards to that particular. Now, am I happy with it? This is the true question. It's important to know where you are, but also the question is, am I happy about it?
01:25:04
Do I wanted to grow to somewhere else, right? I think that's more important question, how do I do this? Thank you, and so a quick follow-up to that question is that? Do you think that there is often, uh, if not, always a correlation with the power dynamics that are in play in in the situation.
01:25:23
Our environment. You're in. Like, you can only be a pleaser in a particular environment where you don't have the power to be, uh, you know, more introspective or aware. Yeah, so, so this is actually right. Speaks of the heart of this class. Because just by knowing yourself, which is the first module of personal intelligence?
01:25:48
Okay. You don't know about this group dynamic, which is culture, elements, and a society, which is the social intelligence. We just talk about it, right, your ability to influence others, whether you are at a high power or no power. Right. So, all of this is actually feeding to. How do you show up as a leader in one of the organization you are?
01:26:13
And not only that, right? I would also argue about how do you absorb information digest information? Make sure they're high quality. You know if we have technical people data people here, you know, the garbage in garbage job? If the input is not high quality, the output is casing positive will become high quality.
01:26:30
Right? So there's so many things we need to work on. This is what I call this as a system. You know to an earlier question about it, can I make a tester for EQ, but I? That's why I'm not a big, you know, advocate for that type of test because it's a simplify the the whole thing so much more than it it is actually is.
01:26:51
Good question.
01:26:56
Anyone else you don't even need to have a question? You can just share your comments, you know, if you feel like, wow, that's an interesting topic, or something may surprise that you go, you know? Yeah, yes, hi, yeah. Um, my question was partially answered in the last, um, bit, but to kind of follow up on it.
01:27:14
And I think you kind of address this a little bit, but but, of course, sort of when you're in a. You know, it can be whatever particular form of leadership role or guidance role or whatever, but where you're able to. Influence the culture or set. Set some of the working conditions.
01:27:33
It says, this is, you know, power dynamics related somewhat. But the question is? Do you? Do you have any advice or tips for when you're essentially able to model or demonstrate or leave people into? Operating in a more emotionally aware or emotionally intelligent way. Like, how would you introduce modeling to that and my background for that is like, I'm doing a lot of?
01:27:59
Um, basically, mentoring, and some like training programs around this. A lot of us are, like, early career folks who are. Maybe at that Gap that you mentioned between being undergraduate or having an MBA, or like, just getting into the more experienced levels. So, I'm just curious if any that could be like a whole lecture, I know.
01:28:17
But, like, any advice or tips on that topic? Yeah, I, I think, uh, um, the best way to start it is really start with yourself. So, you know, to have sort of a self-awareness like, it's basically that a personal intelligence module? Um, have everybody do? Maybe a quick? Assessment in terms of internal where they are and also creating an environment that people is willing to give feedback.
01:28:43
And also creating an environment. Maybe they can audit each other, you know, if you can just pair them as a body body, say, well, we go to the meeting together. You know what you just said, I perceived it this way? Is that, what do you so I think is from leadership.
01:28:56
It's top-down effort. It's like, if you want a culture to become more emotionally aware. Um, I think there's many ways you could do that, but also not just talking about. I think introducing some tools and create some practice, you know, create a very safe environment and build a trust.
01:29:15
And whoever is the leader, I would think you start with you. You demonstrate you leader by example. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, um, and it. Like, it's like, really. I've really been thinking about, like, normalizing the means by which for the feedback and the communication to happen.
01:29:32
Um, it's cute. So thank you, yes. You're welcome! Great question! Yes, Santosh. Yeah, have this question, um, you know, people have different personality so? How does this personality really affect emotional intelligence? Is it like, is there a spectrum between different personalities or how does it really affect? Um. I don't think personality impacting emotional intelligence at all.
01:30:02
Okay, okay, um, based on the method that we're using for strengths profile. Because everybody has strengths. And they're, you're unique to your to you. It depends on how you use it. How often do you use it? How do you we actually develop strategy for you to to practice it, so I'll give you an example like, introvert.
01:30:23
Okay, I'm also somewhat an introvert Spectrum anyway. Um, but uh, you have different. There's different, uh, strands of family in the communication strength. So that I mighty shine, you know, to talk to people, but I may be a great writer. You know, I may be a good Storyteller. Right, so you have different strange family.
01:30:47
You can actually utilize to practice. On your communication side. Um, so introvert extrovert, for I don't know about the science, you know, what's the latest? But most people were thinking they're fixed. What I like about Australians model is their Dynamic. And every one of us can be. Uh, empowered by our own strands.
01:31:09
It's just like the tool that you have in your garage. It depends on what situation you are trying to solve, and you bring different tools to solve that. And you already have all of that. So that's that's why I like that model. All right. Thank you. Welcome! Okay, next, let's save it.
01:31:33
Thank you Professor. Um, Professor. I have a question about corporate life, so in a corporate environment, um, where is the fine line, if any, uh, between being empathetic and understanding employees? This personal lives and work output. Um, and implementing stricter guidelines to fix a company culture or cultural Dynamics in order to promote efficiency and productivity.
01:32:00
Yeah. It's a hard. It's a tough question. It's a tough question. Yeah. Um, I think every company, whether the leader the founders of the company they have to kind of decide, what's the right culture for the company? And I don't think that culture can be individualized, you know, because we're all for the different things.
01:32:22
But I think the the good, the great leaders they made this very clear about. This is the company you're working for. This is the value we stand, you know behind, and this is the company culture. Culture is also Norm. This is how we do things. This is the do's and the domes, so I think the leaders need to decide what's the right culture to grow that business.
01:32:46
I'm sorry and then employees. Kind of trying to find their way. How do you integrate yourself into that system? Okay, so. Particular cases. You know, you might be a little like strict in their eyes, but overall, it's for the betterment of the company. Um, but then later you're like?
01:33:13
Is? You know, like, that's when you have like that retroactive, or like, you reflect on on that, and this is for any corporate boss or anything. Um, but it's like, where is that fine line, because when you not everywhere, but when you show sometimes too much, um, empathy? Um, some people could take advantage, and so.
01:33:37
Um, you know, at the end of the day, our business is, you know, to have some output. Um, not like a social club either, so that's kind of like mostly the question. Yeah, I, I would just say, well, maybe thinking through that, is this problem solving, right? The three steps that we just talked about it?
01:33:56
You know, you know where you are, you know where the company needs to be right from culture aspect standpoint? But then, everywhere in between, right? So, what's the viable option? Whatever works for me might not work for the other person because we're such a different personality, different communication style different, you know, priorities studying our life.
01:34:17
So, I would say thinking about those viable options that you developed? Maybe more tailored to that individual person? Uh, that you think you know because most people will be fine. My experience from the corporate is you're really talking about, maybe the top performer or the bottom performer that they might have their own unique.
01:34:38
You know things that they wanted to take care of? Um, in relation to like, company culture like they can be a change agent because the top performers sometimes say I wanted to change this and that, right? But you need the support, and you know, resources. The bottom might be, like, well, you know.
01:34:53
The reason that I had performed not well, because you know, not me, because something else happened. So, in those particular situations, I was thinking about a viable option for them? It's like, how would you communicate? Why is that culture element important in their lens? What that really mean to them?
01:35:11
Um, I would always start with. Why, like, why do we have this conversation? Why should I care about this? Why is this important? And then go from there. Thank you so much Professor. Welcome! Yes, Kimberly. Hi, um, thank you so much for the lecture. I actually have two questions, um, so the first being from my perspective is just like an early career professional.
01:35:37
How would you? I would love to know your take on. Managing like external self-awareness. When you're constantly receiving feedback and not just bad feedback or good feedback, but I feel like as an early professional, everyone has a lot of opinions. Regarding your work in a lot of those times, it's contradicting.
01:35:56
And so, how would you say, um? What would be your guidance in regards to how to manage that, so you make sure you're getting like an accurate perception of yourself? So, it's very actionable. I will give a few things for you to consider. Okay, one is when I say feedback is gift, right?
01:36:16
So? Thinking about what is a gift? Uh, so let's just say Christmas. You know, you receive all of those gifts. What do you do about this gift? Think about it. Just, you know, this is a conversation. What do you do about this? Yeah. Um. I usually say thank you.
01:36:36
I usually am very like. You know, is it a good gift? Is it how much does this person know? Me, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, so you open up the gift, and then what's the reaction? Uh, usually I'm pleased. But then, you're thinking, okay, this is someone really know me, that this is something I wanted to buy for a long time, you know, now I finally got a yay.
01:37:00
Yeah, I remember this one. I don't know how to use this one, or is it practical for me. Oh, someone's sending me this book. I think my dad would like it. Let me just re-gift it for my dad. So, this is where the gift analogy coming when you receive feedback.
01:37:17
You're always welcome because I view them as a gift, right? But I also wanted to open it up to see what that is. That's where curiosity comes when people willing to give you gifts. They have good intention, assuming they have good all good intentions. And then by sometimes also.
01:37:31
As a clarification, it's like, can you elaborate more? Can you tell me more about that? Can you give me an example. Okay, those are important. It's like, you really understand the feedback. Therefore, you you understand what kind of gift that you received. So you don't change yourself based on all these different feedback, right?
01:37:50
But you really process it through it and thinking about what to keep what to, you know? Sometimes I even return a gift in my class to my students because I did a survey, and they said one of the speakers something. And I said, I disagree. So thank you so much for the gift.
01:38:06
And here you return it back to you. I did it in front of the cars. Everybody laughed, you know, but that's how you do with it. Yeah, so think thinking about that. As an analogy, I think that would take you a long way. No, that's a wonderful analogy. I've never thought about it that way, but I think that's a really positive way, and always allows for like a positive response.
01:38:27
Whether you agree or disagree. Um, and I think my second question ties to this as well. When it comes to like self-awareness and mitigating, like? Societal and our external factors, like, especially for me, as a black woman in corporate. Like, there's so many things I feel like I have to be hyper self-aware of in regards to people's, um, perception of me, and I imagine that lots of people deal with this in their own aspects.
01:38:51
Um, and so. How would you say you kind of between yourself and trust what you know about yourself and what other people know about you or what they perceive of you. And then what the world has kind of said to be true about you based on, you know, whatever, um, factors contribute to who you are?
01:39:09
How do you manage that aspect of it, or where does that tend to come in, and how do you mitigate it? You know, the first advice I would give is, if it's possible, don't put yourself in a box. Yeah, because we could all put it, doesn't matter that we have a lot of people on the screen.
01:39:26
Everybody can put ourselves into a box. And then you're kind of creating this boundary, you know, around yourself, and you feel like that's a fixed thing. We actually talk about this in, um. In the social intelligence module, and there's literally the slides show that you're in a box. I never want you to open a box and coming up.
01:39:47
Um, because you know, um? Because a lot of people enter into whatever the challenge of problem situation is, like the first thing is, why me? Okay, not only you, uh, first of all, many people go through the same experience, and the secondly is also. Um, you're not isolated. You're just not yourself.
01:40:05
If you really think about it, you have so much more resources that you could actually use, whether that being your Mentor, your team, your family, you know, there are many, many people with you together. So, I think when it comes to influence. Uh, inventory. Your resource is very important.
01:40:23
Just all of suddenly you're enlarged. And we also call this as a reframe. Yeah, thank you. Hey, say. Uh, hi, Professor thank you for running the site. Please make sure, so I have a follow-up question on the feedback aspect because we'll be working with diverse environment, and then there'll be different culture, cultural people, Etc.
01:40:47
So, what is the right way to put feedback because some cultures would like a direct feedback. Some would probably like some positive, followed by our feedback. So, should it be like personalized always or yeah? Yeah, it depends on what kind of environment you're talking about, right? Um, you know, I mean, if I use myself as a sort of educator.
01:41:12
And you know, you see, San Diego's environment, especially undergrads, and coming from all over the world. Thanks! Um, so I think it's always, um, and what I like to do. For example, some practice may be helpful, is I always, if I have this one-on-one opportunity with the students that I always like the students to introduce.
01:41:32
You know he himself or herself to me. So I get to know a little bit more before I start giving feedback. Yeah. Okay, so I think. Um, you know, we talk about internal cell phone is external self-awareness. I think in that perspective, it's very important for me to get to know that person first.
01:41:52
Yeah, and then I would also probably, you know, it's a good opportunity to utilize feedback as a gift. Uh, was it just neutralize this so much more? And if you're thinking about if you don't think feedback is in gift? You tend to get a very offensive when people give anything they got about to say.
01:42:10
It's, like, yeah, this is just coming against me, you know, they have been waiting for this moment to get me, right? So, but were you thinking about Evac is a gift? You know, I wanted to share something with you. Um. You know, I want to also give you your space to think about it, right?
01:42:25
In my work, it might not work, um, but this is how I observed how my perspective and I really wanted to help you. And then also give an opportunity for the feedback feedback, right? Like, the look the loop has to happen and have that person share with you about what they're thinking.
01:42:43
Sometimes feedback takes more than one cycle. Because you really need to give this opportunity for both sides to share their thoughts and go back to reflect and coming back together. Thank you. Hey Meredith. Hi there. Um, I really enjoyed the lecture, and I actually really appreciate size question because it my question kind of ties into that.
01:43:09
Um, so earlier, you mentioned. Um, you, you asked us, like, how many of you would be able to to give feedback to, like your supervisor or someone in, like a higher position than you, or like, has more seniority? Um, so my question would be like, what do you recommend for someone who's trying to improve that?
01:43:29
Because, like, like, I feel like for myself, like I do want to be able to? Give that constructive feedback. Like, I do want to share with, like, a supervisor of like. This is how I work better, or like, you know, how do we make this project work, but sometimes like the power dynamics like, kind of, um?
01:43:51
Like, make can make that difficult. Yeah, so there are a couple of things we could. Do you know, I mean, again? We only did so much today, right? So that a lot of tools that we we could utilize is not you're not aware of. But I would say, well, you started with yourself.
01:44:07
That, uh, the, uh, the self-awareness internal strengths that we are talking about. Um, so one strategy we had was you have a particular situation you are going to. We have a strategy is looking to all of your strengths profile. And pick and choose which one. To stack them, let's say four.
01:44:30
Strands together. Going to that particular situation, for example, where I know this might be a tough conversation. So, let me check into my communication. Uh, strands to family. How do I manage this communication today in a way that fit the other side better, right? What is their communication style that I'm aware of that.
01:44:51
How am I going about it? Okay, so? Or, um, that could also, um? Is your strength and then always like, well, this is very much Mission driven, right? And then, so I'm not this. This is not personal, you know? This is right for the benefits of like having a great success or joining success together.
01:45:14
You have to frame the situation. You know, strengths family profile give you an opportunity to frame it. It's like, this is permission. This is, I'm going to communicate this way, right? And I, um, maybe some of the thinking is also thinking thinking stress is also part of your families, you bundle them together and go in there to tackle that situation.
01:45:36
That's what so framing is very important, even if you don't use the stress profile, you frame it because when you don't frame it right. If you're thinking, I'm trying to thinking a frame somewhere. So, you know, if you don't frame it, right? And then, people don't know where you begin.
01:46:01
People like, okay, you're talking to me about that particular situation. I was thinking about the two years ago you did this to me. But that's not related because, you know, I'm not talking about two years ago. I'm talking about this particular situation, so be careful about the way you're going there.
01:46:13
Be very specific about this is, what am I talking about? This framing is important. And then, after you have the framing right, then people may have different perception about. Okay, why did you bring this to me, then reframing comes? Because I'm not just focusing on you, I'm actually focusing on much bigger initiative here.
01:46:34
That's the second step I would have suggest. Um, so talking about the mission, the objective, right, what are you trying to get out of the conversation, you know, to reframe it too much bigger. So, because it's not about just me here, you know, I'm talking about something bigger than me.
01:46:49
And then, I think the last thing will be, um, really. Trying to so one of the influence tool is really trying to switch position. Find a way to bring your supervisor or your manager to your own position because this is what I see. This is what I experienced. You know, um, and?
01:47:10
Um, therefore, they see your perspective. We call this perspective taking is you need to find a way for your supervisor to see from your perspective. Therefore, all of a sudden everything becomes more reasonable. Okay, so what is perspective? Thinking is when you watch a movie. Don't you feel like every character is somewhat reasonable?
01:47:31
But because of the director, find a way to tell their story so you, as a person, watch the movie, you know, character. A, you know, character B, even some horrible movie, you know, murder? You still feel like, well, murder comes from a reason that maybe you know something traumatic things happen to them before.
01:47:46
Therefore, they become that character, right? So that's just an analogy. It's like, if you would be able to have in your supervisor C from your perspective, I mean, then you level the playing field and then they can. You can talk about, you know, more constructive?
01:48:07
A lot of things to it about it, you know, it's not an easy question to answer. So, thank you for that, you know, it gave me. It gave me some good things to to think about. Thank you. Um, one more thing I would offer. Maybe this helps a lot of problems that you may have in mind is a journal.
01:48:25
Uh, however, I think journalist help in itself. It's just like you write it down a situation, you know, you kind of reflect it a little bit. You analyze that a little bit. Uh, but most important, most useful journal is guided, is there's a prompt going through. This is where we actually a powerful tool we use in our class.
01:48:43
Everybody write Journal, trying to solve the problem exactly. The problem, for example, you just brought it up. I had this conversation with my boss. I didn't go well. What am I supposed to? How do I reflect? Actually, this year was talking about. He called off guard because his supervisor, which is a vice president, was epicent for maternity leave.
01:49:04
And he, so he started leading the team going to the meeting and all of a sudden. A cross-functional team reported something and did not give him a heads up and put him at the spot, and he was just don't know how to respond because he did not prepare for an executive meeting, you know, at his level.
01:49:20
Usually, he doesn't even go, so he feels terrible. After this meeting, he was, like, ah, you know, I still know how to respond to this. My now, my vice president, senior vice president, must thought about. I'm not a capable. I'm not the center, so he utilized that a journal to go through that scenario and reflect on what he learned if he wouldn't do this again.
01:49:39
What strengths he would bring to that? How would he influence, you know, all of those modules that we just talked about. We also talk about critical thinking, therefore, he can analyze the situation much more clearly.
01:50:04
Frame the situation correctly.
01:50:11
Okay, more question more comments anybody? Yes. Hi Helen, can you hear me guess I can hear? Yeah, I really enjoy the the session. Thank you so much and I have a question regarding creativity because you mentioned it's like an important part of a, you know, leadership? I personally struggle a little bit on like, you know, creativity, and so I was wondering if you can share with us any recommendations or like tips to how to improve our creativity on how to develop that?
01:50:45
Yeah, so it's a great question, you know? I think there's a misperception about our creativity is, like, how creative I am so people feel like it's almost like a DNA. It's like, yeah, I was born as a creative person, you know, versus yeah, no, I was not right. First of all, I don't.
01:51:02
I'm not in that school of dance. Okay, I think creativity is more of a process. And also creativity is not just about you. A creative creativity. Sometimes most of the time comes from collaboration with others. Right. So if you're willing to be curious, open-minded right to bring people together on that process, and you all will find complimentary with each other.
01:51:30
So, some people are super creative. If you wanted to be creative. Maybe partner with those people, but you play a role, and you learn from them. Um, so I, I think that's how I really like those motto about, like strengths, uh, based. Because everybody is unique. You know, we're always trying to bring the best out of the wherever the other person, other team that I work with.
01:51:53
Um, so I think together it's much more creative and. Innovative and Powerful than just yourself. Um, and also once. If you're having those strengths profile, you will find you probably a lot more than what you thought, because there are so many strengths. Of them, and some of them directly feed into creativity.
01:52:19
It might have a different name. You know, but it's, it's a. It's a source of creativity. Thank you so much! You're welcome! Great question! Anyone else? Professor Wayne. Do you think we could invite folks, maybe one or two more questions, just because in the interest of time for, is that okay with you, of course?
01:52:43
Okay, thank you, and at the 6:30, is that okay it? Actually, it ends at 6:00, and so that's why we've had so many people drop off and had to leave, but I didn't want to interrupt questions because I know people were so engaged and there was so much to comment on.
01:52:57
Thank you so much. Minutes early. It's optional. You probably did not hear me say that I may not have heard. I'm sorry I've had several people direct messaging me, so I was trying to just make sure I got to everyone. But, yeah, absolutely, if that's if 630 is good for you, we're happy to stay on that long.
01:53:18
I knew that 90 minutes was very short, so I offered 30 more minutes if people want to stay, but it's completely optional. You know, if you have something to do? Uh, feel free to. I just am afraid I don't. I personally won't be able. I don't want to leave.
01:53:32
I want to make sure the recording and everything is is set, so I won't be leaving until until we end. Okay, all right. No pressure. So, if anyone has any pressure, we have a couple more minutes if we don't so we can end out a few minutes early, you know, you don't even need to have a question.
01:53:50
Just share your comments. It's fine, too. Um, is the quick question, um. What, like, for some of the things that you mentioned, I'm I'm really interested to like, cite some of it, and I don't know the best way to do that in terms of, like, citing from, like coursework or other materials that you have on these topics.
01:54:09
So, is there any specific thing you'd point me to to best do that or? I'm actually working on that because I'd be very focused on teaching. But the material wise, I mean, we have a lot of content, you know. You can see those videos that we produced in the past.
01:54:27
It's very much related to whatever emotional intelligence. Topic and speakers are so wonderful. So, you feel free to. I mean, this is my perspective, right? We're learning about emotional intelligence, which is a very unique human feature we got to. We really got to learn from people. Um, I don't know, maybe at one point.
01:54:51
I don't know what your perspective everybody's perspective is that, you know, one day, you do. You learn emotional intelligence from AI. I mean, I have a hard time to wrap my back, you know, head around that. We also did their AI would have emotional intelligence, you know, and it's become.
01:55:06
It was a no to begin with, uh, clear, no. But now, become more of a gray area. Because AI does demonstrate some emotional intelligence as well, so it's it's going to be fascinating in the next. Whatever, how many years, you know, see how it goes? Yeah. Okay, Professor, yes, please.
01:55:25
Um, so this one might be a little bit strong of a question, or we might be. It's not a question. It's more of a um, so in your slides, you did mention that when you are very good, well, I mean, you have strong emotional intelligence. Um. When you have that you could, you know, manipulate?
01:55:46
Like people worth, or, you know? Um, the rhetoric. How can you one see it? Uh, when it's happening. Uh, versus, or maybe could be even considered almost gaslighting in a way where? They're trying to get what they want in such a nice way. Um, quote-unquote. Um, and you kind of, like, see under under it.
01:56:14
What's your? What's your take on that? Yeah, I think most people, I mean, give you some time, right? People is going to realize that. I mean, if you really care about that relationship, and I think you need to be very careful about it. I mean, really utilize emotional intelligence as a tool to.
01:56:31
You know, good relationship. In the long-term relationship. Um, if you if people realize, you know, once price is going to break the trust and Trust takes forever to do and only take a moment to break. Going to break that. It probably never come back. So, I want to say, whoever, you know, congratulations yourself.
01:56:52
If you have very emotional intelligence capability, but I think you got into thinking about how do you utilize that a very reasonable, respectable and responsible way, right? Looking for long-term success and for the relationship and people you care the most? And how do you know, like, that's genuine, you know?
01:57:14
Them, trying to be emotionally intelligent or. If they're really, really, emotional intelligence, and you did something that they ask you to do any you later realized right. There are something there. You would not even know what they asking me to do it, and maybe the second time you realize the third time you realized.
01:57:33
But the first time you're probably just? Yeah, we just volunteered. Did whatever you know?
01:57:45
Is super interesting. Thank you. You can, probably. It's a good question. You can probably find some character from movie or books, you know. That way. There are actually not, uh. There are quite a few out there. So, you remind me, maybe I look for some character that everybody knows, you know?
01:58:03
Yes, next question, um, I had a really quick question. Thank you, first of all, for this wonderful lecture. It's been really insightful. Um, I actually wanted to go back to, um, I think one of the questions. Um, that you were addressed earlier about dealing with supervisors that might be difficult and kind of like getting your perspective across to them in a way that they understand.
01:58:28
Um, I guess, my question to you is, if you have supervisors that are really difficult to deal with and understand, how do you kind of go about understanding what their style is? Um, because some supervisors can just be really like ruthless for a lack of a better word, and I feel like in that situation.
01:58:49
How do you kind of tone down the? I guess the cloud of intimidation that they're trying to build and how do you kind of see past that? Yeah. Um. I, I think, um, one way that you could do it. I mean, it's tough, as it's a tough situation, you know, it's.
01:59:10
I had some boss before, um. Very difficult person to work for, but I think one thing is always. Try to find out what's most important for them, so their priorities. And give that to them first. Because that's tied to your performance tied to your trust tied to right. How do you perceive you?
01:59:35
Probably not. You know you're not going to change their style or anything? Um, but it's important to understand what's most important for them and make sure you do those really well. Any of you perform really well. Usually, you know, this happened with my top boss as well, but if you did so well, and then they gave you opportunity to.
01:59:56
To do more, and today would less and more as well. So, in a way, is that you have to earn your response from a tough boss? Right, so find a way. How do you earn that? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you so much for that advice.
02:00:14
The profesencia. What brought my attention was you worked with apple during that peak period of iPods and MacBook and iPhones. So, which was super creative, and I honestly think that was the period that sort of shaped the Apple. So, could you like dive into the curio? Much emotional intelligence was there during this process, maybe from the Steve Jobs perspective.
02:00:40
Yeah, it's the ultimate challenge. You know, Steve Jobs, that time, um, yeah, he's the sole leader for the company, you know, we all respect it so much, but? I don't know if it's a good or bad thing, but I was a little far away from. You know him because I started climbing up.
02:00:54
I graduated with the Apple, but it was a period of time. Yeah, I agree with you. It's early stage. It's very, um, I mean, we have the Mac division, which is doing very much for traditional business, but then we have this all the small device iPhone iPod. A different category.
02:01:12
It's almost like a startup by itself. Um, so I think it challenges me a lot in terms of how to solve problems. Because apple is not that powerful back then, I mean. But, however, we have like impossible expectation because of Steve Jobs. So, he always wanted to make, like, impossible, possible.
02:01:30
So, you know, we, every one of us is tasked to do. How do you actually solve the problem, take the challenge? Make something possible. Become a reality. Um, and, uh, so I think I learned from that experience is. Number one people because you really rely on people, whether that being your engineer colleagues or your supply worldwide.
02:01:54
So, I think, establish that relationship and Trust. Therefore, when you have difficulties and you, ask him for help, and they're willing to trust you and take a risk. So, we are talking about the early stage in the startup is taking risk, right? I cannot personally promise you this is going to be successful, but you know we take a chance?
02:02:12
And then, second. So, I think that, like, people element of it, how do you work with that, but secondly, is a very complex problem. You can solve it once. It's just like a firefighting everywhere, but eventually you need to sustain that Innovation. You need to build a system, so that's where the process and system comes.
02:02:31
You don't, rely. I'm just some people because people have different reactions and different, you know, performance, right? So you need a process plus of people, uh, you know to, to do that. Um, so, then, if you have the people you trust and you work with, and they also trust you.
02:02:45
And then, you also have the process to think of the rest that makes things so much easier. And emotional intelligence comes like almost 360 degree. I would say, you know, it's how do you manage up? How do you manage your cross-functional team. How do you manage your own team?
02:03:00
How do you manage internal stakeholders? How do you manage external stakeholders?
02:03:08
Medexpert or whatever for supply chain. But yeah, that only get me into the door and for me to be successful, like being recognized and being respected being promoted in a way. Got, yeah, I have to be able to get all the people bring all the people along with me.
02:03:23
Yeah, a follow-up question is, like, uh, the creative aspect of the products like the? The iPods are those were super creative at that time, and they did not really exist then. So, was it like coming from the top to the bottom, like someone in the top pitch angled and then motivating everyone at the bottom.
02:03:41
Or was it like distributed team working on it and then pitching it to the cop. So, like, was it was the Steve Jobs like, or some, uh, the top management, the creative heads of them, or was it like coming bottom up? It's both. It depends on degree of innovation you're talking about.
02:03:56
So, at the top, somebody has to Define iPad as a product. That's where Steve Jobs Johnny, I, you know, all of their job, right? Um, but when you know you build something, you create something you never existed before, which means, you know, whatever my responsibility area is also never done before, so I might, just, for example, if you remember of, yeah, iPhone is a good example because I was working on the touch module that was the very first time I thought she was never used anywhere, so that level of innovation I have to be able to work with.
02:04:42
Ideas as well as they Empower the bottom. So, the bottom-up Innovation creativity that we have to carry every day to solve problems? Because problem is, this uncertainty problem is. The problem is something you never deal with before, so you're literally in new situation every time, every day, and then you have to figure out a way that's the Innovation.
02:05:02
Creativity happen. Thank you so much! It was really nice to talk about the crucial period of Africa. I would love to too. Okay, so we're already over time. I really appreciate everybody that was Tuesday. I think we had a fantastic session. Just a quick note is, this is what I loved about this class because everybody has so much to share.
02:05:24
Not only that, you learn from whatever the lecture material I prepared, but you also learn from your peers, right? Everybody has their free experience and contribution to this class.
02:05:37
Thank you! Thank you so much Professor lecture! Thank you! Thank you!
